<h1>FLAXIE FRIZZLE AND DR. PAPA.</h1>

<hr class="r5" />

<p class="ph2" style="margin-top: 1em; margin-bottom: 1em;"><a name="ChI." id="ChI.">I.</a></p>

<h3>THE SCARECROW SISTER.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">One</span> morning little Miss Frizzle danced
about her brother Preston, as he was starting
for school, saying,&mdash;</p>

<p>"If a little boy had one poggit full o'
pinnuts, and one poggit full o' canny, and
one in his hands, how many would he
be?"</p>

<p>This was a question in arithmetic; and,
though Preston was a large boy, he could
not answer it.</p>

<p>"Answer it yourself," said he, laughing.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span></p>

<p>"He'd have fousands and fousands&mdash;as
many as <i>four hundred</i>!" said Flaxie,
promptly.</p>

<p>"Shouldn't wonder! What's the need
of my going to school, when I have a little
sister at home that knows so much?"
cried Preston, kissing her and hurrying
away.</p>

<p>Flaxie wished he and her sister Julia&mdash;or
Ninny, as she called her&mdash;could stay
with her all the time. She was lonesome
when they were both gone; and to-day her
mamma said she must not go out of doors
because her throat was sore.</p>

<p>She stood for awhile by the kitchen
window, looking at the meadow behind the
house. It was sprinkled all over with
dandelions, so bright and gay that Flaxie
fancied they were laughing. <i>They</i> didn't
have sore throats. O, no! they could stay<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
out of doors all day long; and so could
the pretty brook; and so could the dog
Rover; and the horses, Whiz and Slowboy;
and the two young colts.</p>

<p>By-and-by the colts came to the kitchen
window, which was open, and put in their
noses to ask for something to eat. Flaxie
gave them pieces of bread, which Dora
handed her; and they ate them, then ran
out their tongues and licked the window-sill,
to be sure to get all the crumbs.</p>

<p>"What if they should bite you!" said
Dora.</p>

<p>"O, they won't! I'm a doctor's chillen;
they won't bite <i>me</i>," said Flaxie, who was
never afraid of any thing or anybody.</p>

<p>"Well, you mustn't keep that window
open any longer. You'll get cold, if you
<i>are</i> a doctor's children," said Dora. "Run
into the parlor to your mother. Why, you
haven't seen her for an hour."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span></p>

<p>Flaxie was not at all anxious to see her
mother, but ran into the parlor and called
for a slate and pencil. Mrs. Gray gave
them to her; and Flaxie drew pictures for
ten minutes,&mdash;such pictures! Then the
squeaking stopped, and she began to cry.</p>

<p>"What is it, darling?" said mamma.</p>

<p>"I've losted my <i>pessle</i>," sobbed Flaxie.</p>

<p>"O, well, I'll get you another. Don't
cry."</p>

<p>"I've losted it <i>up my nose</i>," screamed
the child, running to her mother in great
distress.</p>

<p>It was true. The pencil was a very short
one; and, in poking it into her nose, just
for fun, she had pushed it too far, and it
would not come out. Mrs. Gray tried her
very best; but the harder she tried the
further up went the pencil, and the more
Flaxie's nose bled and swelled. It was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
growing worse every minute; and Mrs.
Gray, not knowing what else to do, called
Dora from the kitchen and sent her for
"Dr. Papa."</p>

<p>When Flaxie knew her father was sent
for, she cried louder than ever; for she
thought she must be dreadfully hurt.</p>

<p>"Is I a-goin' to die?" said she. "I
wouldn't die for fi-ive dollars!"</p>

<p>"No, indeed, pet, you won't die. Dr.
Papa will make you all well in two minutes."</p>

<p>"Will he? O, dear, my nose is <i>so</i> sick!
Kiss it, mamma!"</p>

<p>Mamma kissed the poor purple little
nose, which helped Flaxie very much; but
she burst out afresh, next moment. "How
bad Dr. Papa'll feel when he comes home!"</p>

<p>Her mother soothed her; but soon she
fell to crying again.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span></p>

<p>"How <i>Ninny</i>'ll feel when <i>she</i> comes
home!"</p>

<p>Mrs. Gray comforted her for this with
more kisses; but presently Flaxie sobbed
out once more,&mdash;</p>

<p>"How <i>Pesson</i> will feel when <i>he</i> comes
home!"</p>

<p>For the child truly believed her friends
would grieve more about it than she did.</p>

<p>Dr. Papa hurried to his darling as fast
as he could; but, by the time he got
home, her nose was badly swelled, and he
had to hurt her very much in order to get
out the "pessle." When it was all over,
he took her on his knee, and tried to make
her forget her troubles by showing her
some pictures.</p>

<p>"The man in this picture is a school-teacher,"
said he; "and the little boy who
stands by his desk must have been naughty,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
for the teacher is going to whip him with
that stick."</p>

<p>"Goin' to w'ip him? Well, I'll wait
and <i>see</i> if he w'ips him," said Flaxie, folding
her hands and staring at the picture
with all her might.</p>

<p>Dr. Papa laughed. He often laughed at
what Flaxie said; and Mrs. Prim, a lady
who lived in town, thought he "spoiled
her." Perhaps he did.</p>

<p>"O, see the pretty chickies," said the
child, as her father turned to another picture.
"Does God make chickies?"</p>

<p>"Certainly."</p>

<p>"Well," said she, thoughtfully, "how
they must have <i>hollered</i> when he stuck the
fedders in!"</p>

<p>I must confess Dr. Papa laughed again.
Then he put Flaxie down, and said he
must go, though she held him by the vest-buttons,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
and declared the next picture
would be "awful funny."</p>

<p>"How do you know?"</p>

<p>"O, I <i>guess</i> it will!"</p>

<p>"Well, dear, if it's ever so funny, Dr.
Papa will have to go, for a sick lady
wants to see him."</p>

<p>"Did the lady get a pessle up <i>her</i> nose?"</p>

<p>"No, she didn't; but she is very sick
for all that. Good-by, pet."</p>

<p>As Dr. Gray went out of the yard, he
said to his stable-boy,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Crawford, I think the crows are getting
too much of that corn we planted. Can't
you put up a scarecrow?"</p>

<p>Crawford thought he could, and went
into the house to ask Dora for some old
clothes.</p>

<p>"I'll tell you what you'd better do,
Crawford," said Dora.  "Make a <i>little</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
scarecrow, and dress it up like Flaxie
Frizzle. I'll get you some of her old
clothes."</p>

<p>"That's just the thing," replied Crawford.
"Give me her red hood and waterproof,
and I'll stuff 'em out with hay. O, my,
won't the crows be scared?"</p>

<p>Crawford chuckled to himself all the
while he was making this little image;
and, when it was done, he carried it out to
the corn-field, and fastened it upon a stump.</p>

<p>"Well, it does look exactly like her,
and the crows won't know the difference,"
said he: "only she couldn't keep still to
save her life. Guess I'll pin on a veil or
something to blow in the wind, as if she
was moving."</p>

<p>Dora gave him an old red scarf; and it
certainly did make the image look very
much as if it were alive. People who rode
by turned to gaze at it, and said,&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span></p>

<p>"There's the doctor's baby. I'm glad
her mother has wrapped her up so well:
it's pretty cold weather for this time of
year."</p>

<p>But you must know Flaxie Frizzle was
surprised when <i>she</i> saw the scarecrow! She
had climbed the sofa, and was looking out
of the window. What did she see, standing
there in the corn-field? It was her
own self! She rubbed her eyes, and looked
again.</p>

<p>"O mamma, mamma," called she. "Come
here <i>just</i> as kick! You s'pose, mamma,
who's playing <i>coop</i> out there? It's ME!
And <i>here's</i> ME, right here! Have I got a
little sister?"</p>

<p>It was some time before she could be
made to understand that the scarecrow was
not herself, was not alive, and was only a
rag-baby made of sticks and straw and old
clothes.  The next day it rained from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
morning till night; and everybody who
went by the house thought it too bad that
poor Flaxie Frizzle should be in the corn-field,
getting so wet.</p>

<p>At least a dozen times the door-bell
rang; and a dozen people told Dora to be
sure and let Mrs. Gray know her baby
was out in the rain!</p>

<p>Dora laughed, and assured the kind people
that "<i>that</i> baby in the field was neither
sugar nor salt, and water wouldn't
hurt her a grain."</p>

<p>But she told Crawford "it did her good
to see how much the neighbors thought of
Flaxie Frizzle, for all she was such a curious-acting
child."</p>

<p>"And, Crawford, you'll have to take
down that 'scarecrow sister,' and put up
something else; for I can't spend my time
running to the door to explain to folks
that it isn't Flaxie Frizzle."</p>

<p class="ph3">FLAXIE'S DOSE.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">That</span> summer Grandpa Pressy came to
Dr. Gray's, visiting. Flaxie Frizzle had
five grandfathers, but she loved Grandpa
Pressy best of all; and he loved her, too,
and called her his "little boy."</p>

<p>Now, the dear old gentleman had a poor
memory; and, if he laid down his newspaper
or spectacles, he hardly ever knew where
to find them.</p>

<p>"I guess I left my silk handkerchief up
stairs," said he, one morning. "Won't my
little boy run up, and get it off the
bureau?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span></p>

<p>Flaxie went in a moment, but the handkerchief
was not there. There was a silver
box on the bureau, though, a very pretty
one; and Flaxie thought she would open
it and see what was in it. It was an old-fashioned
snuff-box. Grandpa Pressy did
not use snuff, but he carried his medicines
in this box when he went away from
home. There were three kinds of medicine,&mdash;cough
lozenges, sugar-coated pills,
and a tiny bottle wrapped in cotton-wool,
and marked "wine of antimony."</p>

<p>First, Flaxie took out a cough lozenge,
and put it on her tongue; but it was rather
fiery, and she said,&mdash;</p>

<p>"O, it quackles me."</p>

<p>She would not touch the "candy pills,"
for she had seen the same sort before, and
knew they were bitter inside; but she
picked the vial out of the cotton-wool, held<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
it up to the light, and thought it looked
"very nice."</p>

<p>"Mayn't I have some, grandpa?" whispered
she.</p>

<p>She knew her gampa was not there
to hear her: it was a way she had of talking
to herself.</p>

<p>"Mayn't I have some, gampa?" Then
she smiled very sweetly, and replied
aloud,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Yes, little boy, you <i>may</i> have some."</p>

<p>Ah, Flaxie, Flaxie! To think you should
know no better than to meddle with such
dreadful things! The antimony was as
poisonous as it could be; but, if anybody
had told you so, you would have swallowed
it all the same, I suppose, you silly little
creature!</p>

<p>How much antimony Flaxie took, I'm
sure I don't know, but it was a great deal;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
and it frightens me now to think of it, for
this is a true story.</p>

<p>"I'm a doctor's chillen; I <i>mus'</i> take
mederson," said she, making a wry face as
she found it did not taste at all "nice."</p>

<p>Suddenly a voice called out,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Where's that try-patience?"</p>

<p>It was Dora; she was close by the door.
Flaxie threw the vial and the box behind
the looking-glass, and answered, in an innocent
tone,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Here I is!"</p>

<p>Of course she knew Dora meant <i>her</i>; for
Dora never, never called anybody else a
"try-patience."</p>

<p>"What are you up in this chair for,
rummaging round in folks' bureaux?"
said Dora, hugging and scolding and
shaking her, all in a breath.</p>

<p>"I wasn't doin' nuffin," said guilty little<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
Flaxie, pouting. "If you scold to me,
Dodo, I'll <i>make</i> me a naughty little goorl!"</p>

<p>"You're always naughty, without <i>making</i>.
There, now, come away: this room is
no place for you."</p>

<p>"O, now I know what I camed for,"
said Flaxie; "it was gampa's hang-ger-fiss."</p>

<p>"O, lor', I found his hang-ger-fiss long
ago in the dining-room. Away with you.
I want to make the bed."</p>

<p>As Dora spoke, she kissed Flaxie; and I
wonder she didn't perceive that the child's
breath smelt of medicine.</p>

<p>"There, there, you're an old darling,"
said Dodo, "whatever you do."</p>

<p>That was the way Dora's scoldings
usually ended; and Flaxie did not mind
them in the least. She danced down stairs
in a great hurry; for, in the front yard<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
under the trees, her brother Preston and
two other boys were swapping jack-knives,
and Miss Frizzle always liked to be on the
spot when any thing was going on.</p>

<p>The boys all smiled when they saw her
coming; and Preston drew her close to his
side, and straightened the lace frill in the
neck of her dress. He was only eight
years old; but he had always felt a great
deal of care of his little sister.</p>

<p>"Come here, Miss Frizzle, and I'll put
you in my pocket," said Bert Abbott.</p>

<p>"Got some canny in your poggit? If
you have, I'll go," responded Flaxie, with
a roguish smile.</p>

<p>This was considered such a bright speech
that the boys, all three, turned their pockets
inside out to see if they had any
sweetmeats to offer. Bert Abbott found a
broken tart, and Jack Snow a few peanuts.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
Flaxie took the "pinnuts" with a cool
little nod, but the tart was not to her fancy.</p>

<p>"'Cause I don't like pie-grust, and <i>that's</i>
because," said she, curling her lip as she
looked at the crumbs.</p>

<p>"Guess you don't like 'pinnuts' either,"
said Jack Snow; for she was dropping the
shells down Preston's back and the kernels
into the grass.</p>

<p>"Yes, I like 'em; pinnuts is <i>le-licious</i>,"
replied Flaxie, faintly; but she was beginning
to grow rather pale round the mouth.</p>

<p>"Come, boys," said Preston, who had
not the slightest idea that any thing ailed
his precious sister, "let's go and have our
sail. I'll run and get Flaxie's hat."</p>

<p>They called it "sailing;" but it was
merely rocking about in the pretty boat,
called the "Trout-fly," which was moored
on the bank of the brook. As the boys<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
did not know how to swim, Dr. Gray
never allowed them to unfasten the boat.</p>

<p>It was a lovely day. The hills were as
blue as the sky, and the sky was as soft
as a dream. What harm was there in
having a little "sail" in that black and
green "Trout-fly?" Preston thought they
were doing a proper thing, and so they
were; but the young passenger they took
with them was soon to give them a world
of trouble.</p>

<p>The boys had a pretty good time; but
they could not make Flaxie talk: she said
her "teef were tired." There was an
anxious look on her face, and she never
once smiled.</p>

<p>"What under the sun ails you?" said
Preston, as she threw herself down in the
bottom of the boat, with her head on his
feet.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span></p>

<p>"I don' know," replied Flaxie; for she
had no more remembrance of her dose of
poison than a kitten has of its last saucer
of cream.</p>

<p>"Are you sleepy?"</p>

<p>"No; but my <i>eyes</i> are."</p>

<p>"Let her go to sleep; don't bother her,"
said Jack Snow.</p>

<p>"Yes, I shall bother her too. She's
real white; and I can't stand it," said
Preston, stroking her cold cheeks in alarm.</p>

<p>At that Flaxie began to cry. She was
not in pain, as she had been when she got
the slate-pencil up her nose; but somehow
she felt very unhappy.</p>

<p>"Guess I's goin' to die," sobbed she.</p>

<p>"Why, Flaxie Frizzle Gray, what do
you mean by such talk as that? What
do <span class="smcap">YOU</span> know about dying?"</p>

<p>"O, I know 'bout it; we'll all die some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
day, mamma said so; guess it's <i>some day</i>
now," gasped Flaxie, mournfully.</p>

<p>"That's not a pretty way to talk," said
Bert Abbott. "Here, eat a raisin, Flaxie,
that's a good baby."</p>

<p>Flaxie shut her eyes firmly, and would
not touch the raisin. Preston began to
feel uneasy: he had never seen his sister's
rosy little face look like this before. "See
here, boys," said he, "let's get out of this,
and I'll carry Flaxie home to mother."</p>

<p>If he could only have done it! But,
somehow, before he had fairly got the child
in his arms, she drew away from him and
leaned over the stern of the boat. I suppose
she was blind and dizzy; but, at any
rate, she lost her balance and fell head-first
into the brook, which was deep enough,
even by the shore, to drown a man. It
was done so quickly that nobody had time<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
to stop her. Jack Snow reached out as
far as he could and clutched the hem of
her cambric dress; but it slipped through
his fingers, and the child sank down, down
to the very bottom.</p>

<p>"Hullo there!" screamed the boy, as if
that could do the least good!</p>

<p>Preston plunged into the water. He did
not know how to swim much; but he never
stopped to think of himself, he must save
his darling sister. O, <i>where</i> was she?
Why didn't she rise to the surface? He
had heard his father say that people did
not drown till they had risen at least once.
Perhaps you, who know of Flaxie's taking
poison, can guess why she did not rise.
She had fainted away!</p>

<p>Preston dived, but came up without her.
She had gone out of his reach. When he
rose, he said to himself,&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span></p>

<p>"I'll never go home without my darling
sister! If she drowns, I'll drown!"</p>

<p>"Jump into the boat," screamed the
boys. "It's no use; you can't get her!"</p>

<p>"Yes, I <i>will</i>," said Preston, and dived
again. That time, without knowing it, he
<i>almost</i> touched Flaxie, lying still as a log,
ten feet below.</p>

<p>When he came up, the boys reached after
him and pulled him into the boat. He
struggled with all his might; but it was two
against one, and he could not help himself.</p>

<p>"Oogle, oogle, goggle!" screamed he; for
his mouth was so full of water that he could
not speak.</p>

<p>"Pat him on the back," said Jack Snow,
always ready with advice.</p>

<p>"Oogle, oogle, oggle, goggle!" cried
Preston, striking out both arms, and determined
to dive again; but the boys held<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
him fast. If they had not held him, he
would certainly have drowned, but he
could not have saved Flaxie. He had
courage enough, and will enough for a
grown man; but, alas, his strength was
only that of a little boy.</p>

<p>And what could be done? Bert Abbott
ran up the bank, screaming for help. Was
all the world deaf? If those boys had
never prayed before, they prayed now.
"Help us, help us, O God, <i>won't</i> you help
us? Send somebody to save Flaxie!"</p>

<p>It was quite five minutes&mdash;so I am told&mdash;that
the child lay in that brook before
any help came. At last a man, who was
going by, heard the outcry, and thought
it sounded like something more than boys'
play. He ran to the spot; and, as he could
swim, he soon had Flaxie out of the water;
but, whether dead or alive, that was the
question.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span></p>

<p>There she lay in his arms, as still as a
stone. The water dripped from her beautiful
flaxen hair, from the tips of her white
fingers, from her dimpled chin; but not an
eyelash stirred, and her little heart had
ceased to beat.</p>

<p>"The poor thing is clean gone, no
mistake about that," thought the man, putting
his lips to Flaxie's cold mouth.</p>

<p>"Rub her! Roll her! Run for father!"
shouted Preston, flinging himself upon his
lifeless sister, and kissing her wildly.</p>

<p>"Here, boys, you run ahead and get the
doctor, and I'll carry her to the house as
quick as I can," said Mr. Bond.</p>

<p>"Don't take on so," added he, soothingly
to Preston. "Folks do come to, sometimes,
and live, when they look as far gone
as she does."</p>

<p>He said this from the kindness of his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
heart; but in reality he had very little hope
of Flaxie. Dr. Gray had scarcely any
hope either: he thought she had been in
the water too long.</p>

<p>Ever so many men and women worked
over the child for hours and hours: Dr.
Papa and mamma among the rest, of course;
and even Grandpa Pressy helped a little,
though his hands trembled, and he was
very pale. It did not seem to be of the
least use; still, they kept trying.</p>

<p>"O, you dear, beautiful baby," said Mrs.
Gray, the tears falling over her cheeks, "it
is so hard to give you up!"</p>

<p>Dr. Papa held his cold little darling, his
"Pinky Pearly," to his heart; but he could
not speak a word.</p>

<p>But, just as they were all giving her up,
she was seen to breathe, very, very softly.</p>

<p>"Saved!" whispered Dr. Papa.</p>

<p>"Saved!" echoed mamma.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span></p>

<p>"Thank God!" said Grandpa Pressy.</p>

<p>How did Preston feel when his dear sister
slowly opened her blue eyes? He
would have given his life for her,&mdash;was he
glad she was saved? Ah, <i>was</i> he glad, the
noble boy?</p>

<p>In a few minutes Dr. Papa knew the
whole story: he found out that Flaxie had
been taking poison.</p>

<p>"Now I understand it all," said he.
"She fainted away before she fell into the
brook. If she had not fainted she could
not have lived so long under the water."</p>

<p>"Was that what made her lie so still?"
asked Preston. "If she had moved a little
I might have pulled her out; but she
wouldn't move, and I couldn't reach her."</p>

<p>"You tried your best, my son," said the
doctor, laying his hand on Preston's head.
"It makes me happy to think my little
girl has such a brother!"</p>

<p class="ph2" style="margin-top: 1em; margin-bottom: 1em;"><a name="ChIII." id="ChIII.">III.</a></p>

<p class="ph3">THE KNITTING-WORK PARTY.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Flaxie</span> recovered from this accident a
great deal sooner than Grandpa Pressy did.
Somehow, the shock of seeing his "little
boy" lying so white and cold made grandpa
ill. He was so ill, in fact, that Dr.
Gray sent for grandma.</p>

<p>It was very pleasant having grandma in
the house; and her dear old husband began
to feel better the moment he saw her.</p>

<p>"Dear little Mary, how do you do?"
said she to Flaxie, who was lying on the
bed. Flaxie made no answer, except to put
out her tongue.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span></p>

<p>"Can't you speak to grandma?" said
Ninny.</p>

<p>"No: I'm a doctor's chillen, and doctor's
chillen <i>always</i> puts out their tongues," replied
Flaxie, showing it again.</p>

<p>"It doesn't look very sick," said grandma,
laughing.</p>

<p>"Then what makes my mamma keep me
in bed?" whined Flaxie. "I don't want
to be in my nightie. I want to be in my
pretty dress, and sit in your lap."</p>

<p>"She is very, very cross," said Ninny to
grandma, with a patient smile, as they left
the room.</p>

<p>"Perhaps we can amuse her," replied
grandma; and next morning she gave her
some bright worsted to make her doll, Miss
Peppermint Drop, a scarf.</p>

<p>Flaxie was well pleased, for awhile,
tying the worsted into knots and putting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
it over the needles; but it soon tired her.</p>

<p>"O gramma, the needles won't knit:
they're <i>crooksey</i> needles," said she.</p>

<p>"Well, come sit in my lap, dear, and
I'll tell you a story about a knitting-work
party, that I had a great, great while ago,
when I was about as old as Julia."</p>

<p>"That's a funny party, <i>I</i> should fink,"
said Flaxie, curling her head down on her
grandma's shoulder.</p>

<p>"A knitting-work party, did you say?"
asked Ninny, preparing to listen.</p>

<p>"Well, yes. You know girls in those
times didn't have so many parties as they
do now," replied grandma; "and I had
been wanting this one for weeks and weeks
before I even dared ask my mother about
it. When I did ask her, she said,&mdash;</p>

<p>"'Why, Polly, don't you see how much
spring-work I have to do? How can I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
stop to cook a supper for a dozen little
girls?'</p>

<p>"'O, but I'll cook it myself,' said I.
'I can make gingerbread and cup-custards.'</p>

<p>"'And what will you do for bread?'
said she.</p>

<p>"I didn't think there would be any
trouble about that. 'There was <i>always</i> bread
enough,' I said. 'Little girls didn't eat
much, and twelve wouldn't make the <i>least</i>
difference!'</p>

<p>"Well, but mother wanted to know what
I could give them for sauce. The dried
apples were all gone, and she couldn't let
me have any preserves; she was keeping
those for sickness.</p>

<p>"I said I would give them some molasses.
I liked molasses, and thought everybody
else did.</p>

<p>"Mother smiled.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span></p>

<p>"'But if I let you have a party,' said
she, 'you can't do your knitting. You
know I'm in a hurry for you to finish
father's socks.'</p>

<p>"That was what made me think of turning
it into a knitting-work party. I spoke
up in a moment, and said I,&mdash;</p>

<p>"'O mother! if you'll only let me have
it, I'll ask all the girls to bring their knitting-work,
and then we'll measure yarns!
O, won't that be grand? And, when we
get our stints done, we'll go out and play
in the barn. We won't trouble you one
speck.'</p>

<p>"'Well, Polly,' said mother, 'I've a great
mind to say yes; for that sounds to me
like a very sensible kind of a party; and
will be setting a good example too. Yes,
you may have it, if your sisters are willing
to show you how to cook, and you won't
make <i>me</i> any trouble.'</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span></p>

<p>"You may depend I was pleased. I
skipped off to the kitchen in great glee,
and danced about the kneading-trough,
where sister Judith was mixing brown-bread,
crying out,&mdash;</p>

<p>"'I'm going to have a <i>knitting-work
party</i>, Judy, and cook it myself! Give
me a pan and a spoon!'</p>

<p>"My eldest sister, Sally, was pounding
spices in a mortar; and I remember Judith
turned to her, and said,&mdash;</p>

<p>"'Now, Sally, you <i>don't</i> suppose mother
is going to let that child bother round?'</p>

<p>"'O, <i>I</i> shan't bother,' said I. 'I'm only
going to make gingerbread and cup-custards.
'Twill be very easy!'</p>

<p>"Sally laughed,&mdash;she was very good-natured,&mdash;and
told me to run out to the
barn for some eggs. While I was gone,
I suppose she and Judith talked the matter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
over, and thought they would keep me
out of the kitchen; for, as soon as I came
back, they sent me off to give my invitations.</p>

<p>"'We'll do the cooking,' said Sally;
'but you may set the table yourself, and
wait upon your little girls. We will not
see them at all.'</p>

<p>"I ran off, happy enough; and I have
thought a great many times since, how
kind it was in Sally and Judith to leave
their work to do that baking for me.
They were good sisters, certainly.</p>

<p>"I had a grand time that morning, going
from house to house, asking my friends to
my knitting-work party. Everybody was
delighted; and everybody came, of course,
and got there by two o'clock, or earlier.</p>

<p>"Mother left her quilting long enough
to put marks with red worsted into each
little girl's knitting-work.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span></p>

<p>"'There,' said she, 'at four o'clock I
will come to see which has beat. I must
be the one to judge; for there is a difference
in your yarn,&mdash;some is coarse and
some is fine; and we must be fair about
it.'</p>

<p>"'O, yes'm,' said the girls; 'we want
to be fair.'</p>

<p>"'Well, now I'll leave you,' said mother;
'and I hope you'll have a nice time.'</p>

<p>"And we did, for awhile. As we sat
busy with our knitting, we heard now and
then the tender bleating of a lamb in the
barn,&mdash;how well I remember that!</p>

<p>"'That's my cosset,' said I. 'She hasn't
any mother, you know. I'll show her to
you, girls, when we get our knitting done.'</p>

<p>"Persis Russell 'didn't see the use of
waiting,' she said. 'Why couldn't we run
out and look, and right back again?'</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span></p>

<p>"Just then the lamb began to bleat
louder, and in a very beseeching tone, as
if he felt lonesome and wanted company.
It seemed to touch the girls' hearts; and
they sprang up, and started for the door&mdash;all
but me.</p>

<p>"'Well, run along if you want to,' said
I, 'I'll come in a minute.'</p>

<p>"'But you mustn't stay here and keep
on knitting,' said they; 'that wouldn't be
fair.'</p>

<p>"'I don't mean to keep on knitting. I
won't knit another stitch; but I want to
sweep up the hearth,' said I.</p>

<p>"As I spoke, I dared not look anybody
in the face, for a dreadfully wicked
thought had come into my head.</p>

<p>"If I could only pick out the mark
mother had put in my work, and sew in
another lower down! A black satin bag<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
was hanging on a nail by the window; and
in the bottom of the bag was a needlebook
with the very needle and red worsted
mother had used to sew in the marks!</p>

<p>"The girls ran out, and I seized that
needle&mdash;O, how thick and fast my heart
beat! It was as much as I could do to
make the stitch, my fingers trembled so.
But I did it. I put in the mark almost
an inch below the right place, and picked
out the first mark with a pair of scissors.
Then I swept up the hearth a little bit,
and went out to the girls.</p>

<p>"They were so delighted with the lamb
that they scarcely looked at me; if they
had, they must have seen something strange
in my face.</p>

<p>"'Come, girls,' said I, speaking very fast,
'let's go right back and knit; and, when
it's four o'clock, we'll come back here and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
play Ring Round Rosy, and every thing else.'</p>

<p>"They were willing enough to go back;
and for half an hour our fingers flew fast;
but I took good care not to let any one
see the mark in my stocking.</p>

<p>"Just as the clock in the kitchen struck
four, mother came in with a pleasant smile
for all the little girls; and they brought
their knitting-work along to her with blushing
faces, for children in those days were
more bashful than they are now. Mother
took the thirteen pieces of knitting-work,
and laid them down together. Little Polly
Lane had knit the least of any one, which
was not strange, for she was the youngest.
Nancy Shaw came next; then Ellen Rice
and Phebe Snow. Persis Russell was the
oldest, and known to be a very 'smart' girl.
Her stocking was seamed, and she had knit
a longer piece than Mary Jane Cullen;&mdash;another<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
'smart' girl;&mdash;but, strange to say,
Flaxie, not a single one had done as well
as your little grandmother! Mother was
surprised: she had not supposed I could
knit as fast as Persis Russell, who was
twelve years old; but here was my stocking
right before her; it was finer than Persis's,
and the mark was half an inch lower down!</p>

<p>"'Well, I didn't expect this,' said mother;
'but I shall have to give it up that Polly
has beat. You may come here and see for
yourselves!'</p>

<p>"The girls looked, and some of them
could not help feeling disappointed. I know
Mary Jane Cullen had thought if anybody
beat her it would be Persis Russell; and
Persis knew her fingers had moved faster
than mine; yet I had got ahead of them
both!</p>

<p>"You may be sure I was very modest,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
and did not put on any airs. I felt rather
sober in spite of my victory. We played
noisy games for an hour, and then I said
I must go in and set the table, for this
was <i>my</i> party. I didn't say I had done
the cooking, but I was quite willing they
should think I had. When supper was
ready I called the girls in, and asked Persis
Russell to sit at one end of the table while
I sat at the other and poured the tea. It
was currant-leaf tea, and wouldn't have
kept a baby awake. Then Persis passed
the bread, and asked if I made it, and I
had to say, 'no.'</p>

<p>"'And you didn't make the gingerbread,
either, I suppose,' said she; and I had to
say 'no' again, 'I only stirred it.'</p>

<p>"Persis felt better when she heard that.
I wasn't the smartest girl in the town of
Concord after all.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span></p>

<p>"'Who made the custards?' asked she.</p>

<p>"'Well, Sally made those,' said I; 'but
I hunted up the eggs.'</p>

<p>"Then little Polly Lane said she could
hunt eggs, if that was all.</p>

<p>"And Patty Stevens said, 'Yes, so could
she; and her mother said <i>she</i> might have
a knitting-work party if she'd have it just
the way Polly did; and she was going to
tell her how Polly didn't have to cook the
things.'</p>

<p>"'I hope Polly won't begin to knit till
the rest of us get started,' said Mary Jane
Cullen; 'for I don't think it's fair.'</p>

<p>"O, I tell you, Flaxie, by that time I
had begun to feel ashamed of myself; and,
at seven o'clock, when my party was all
over, and the girls had gone home, I felt
more ashamed still. I sat down on the
meal-chest in the back room where Sally<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
was churning, and watched the dash as it
moved up and down, and the cream oozed
out around the little hole in the cover.
She asked me if I'd had a good time. She
said she thought the girls had all behaved
very well.</p>

<p>"'Why, yes, we'd had a <i>pretty</i> good
time,' I said, rather faintly; and I helped
myself to the cream till Sally sent me off
for fear I'd be down sick.</p>

<p>"By that time I was feeling very
wretched; I did not really know why.
Perhaps it was all knitting-work; and perhaps
it was partly cream;&mdash;and I began
to think some of it might be molasses. I
went to bed, but could not go to sleep, and
fell to crying all by myself in the dark.
Mother heard me, and came in to ask what
was the matter.</p>

<p>"'I want to see my little sister Abby,'
said I; 'that's what I'm crying for.'</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span></p>

<p>"'But you never saw your sister Abby,'
said mother; 'she died before you were
born.'</p>

<p>"'I know it, mother,' sobbed I. 'I never
saw her, and that's why I want to see her
now!'</p>

<p>"'Is that all you're crying about, Polly?'
said mother. 'I'm afraid something happened
wrong at your party.'</p>

<p>"'O mamma, I'm ashamed to tell,' said
I, covering my head with the sheet. 'I
guess I ate too much molasses&mdash;I&mdash;I&mdash;'</p>

<p>"'Well, daughter, and what else?' said
mother.</p>

<p>"'I ate too much cream,&mdash;I&mdash;I&mdash;'</p>

<p>"Mother waited patiently.</p>

<p>"'I picked out the marking you put
into my knitting-work, and I sewed in another
lower down,' cried I, desperately. 'O
dear, O, dear, I did. O mother, I knew
you'd feel bad! Say, what shall I do?'</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span></p>

<p>"Mother was so surprised and distressed
that she did not speak for nearly a minute,
and then she said,&mdash;</p>

<p>"'It was a dreadful thing, Polly. Do
you think you are truly sorry?'</p>

<p>"'O, yes, I guess you'd think so,'
sobbed I, 'if you knew how I feel right in
here. It's a little speck of it molasses and
cream, but most of it's knitting-work;
and I want to get right up and dress myself,
and go and tell the girls how I
cheated.'</p>

<p>"'Are you willing to tell them?' asked
mother.</p>

<p>"'Yes, I want to: 'twill choke me if I
don't,' said I. 'Patty Stevens is going to
have a knitting-work party, and I can tell
the girls there; but seems 'sif I can't
wait.'</p>

<p>"'If you feel like that,' said mother, 'I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
believe you are truly sorry. And now let
us tell our Heavenly Father about it, and
I know he will freely forgive you.'</p>

<p>"There," said Grandma Pressy, smoothing
down her cap as she finished, "that's
the whole story; but it is a bitter thought
to me that I was ever such a naughty
child."</p>

<p>"It's bitter to me, too," said Flaxie,
making a wry face. "Won't you give me
an ollinge, now, to take the taste out?"</p>

<p class="ph2" style="margin-top: 1em; margin-bottom: 1em;"><a name="ChIV." id="ChIV.">IV.</a></p>

<p class="ph3">MAKING FLAXIE HAPPY.</p>


<p>"<span class="smcap">We</span> <i>thought</i>, in the first place, my little
sister had water on the brain, her head was
under water so long," explained Preston to
the boys; "but she has got over it now,
only dreadful cross."</p>

<p>It was a hard time for everybody when
Flaxie was cross. She tried to sew, but
her work acted "orfly;" the stitches were
"cross-eyed," she said.</p>

<p>"I hate my padge-work," cried she,
angrily; "I hate it <i>dead</i>!"</p>

<p>"Then I wouldn't sew," said kind
Ninny. "Come out to the shed, and I'll
swing you."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span></p>

<p>That was no better. After swinging a
little while, Flaxie happened to fall off a
pile of boards, and ran into the house,
crying out,&mdash;</p>

<p>"I swang and I swang; up real high,
most up to the sky. Hurt me <i>orfly</i>. Look
at my stoggins and see'f I didn't."</p>

<p>"Perhaps you'd like to hear a story,"
said Mrs. Gray, taking the child in her
lap.</p>

<p>"Yes, tell me a story with a long end
to it. Tell about Cindrilla."</p>

<p>Mrs. Gray began; and, when she got as
far as this,&mdash;"Cinderella asked her mother,
and her mother said, 'No, Cinderella, you
can't go to the party,'" then Flaxie smiled.
Somehow she liked to hear about Cinderella's
having a hard time: she thought she
had a hard time herself. But, when the
story was half done, she wanted something
else.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span></p>

<p>"You don't tell good stories, mamma. I
wish you'd never been made!"</p>

<p>"O, how can you talk so to your good
mother?" said Ninny, much shocked.
"You'd better tell a story yourself, and
see if you can do better than she does."</p>

<p>"Well, mamma," returned Flaxie, "do
you want me to tell a story?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Does God know I'm going to tell it?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Does He know what it is?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Did He always know?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"<i>Forever</i> and always?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Well," said Flaxie, puckering up her
lips, "I ain't a-goin' to tell it; so <i>now</i>
what'll he fink?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span></p>

<p>Mrs. Gray tried not to smile when Flaxie
said such strange things about God; but
this time Ninny laughed aloud.</p>

<p>"Now, Ninny, you needn't laugh to me,"
said Flaxie. "I'm going to be mad with
you a whole week."</p>

<p>"What for?"</p>

<p>"'Cause you won't make Pep'mint Drop
no boots, and <i>that's</i> because."</p>

<p>"Seems to me you scold very hard at
your sister," said Grandma Pressy. "<i>I</i>
think she is a very good sister."</p>

<p>Ninny was standing by the sink at that
very moment, washing Peppermint Drop's
stockings in a pint dipper; and Flaxie was
beside her, cutting soap.</p>

<p>"I know what I'll do," thought Ninny,
wringing the suds from her hands. "I'll
see mamma alone, and ask her if she won't
let Flaxie take my place, and ride to New<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
York this afternoon. Perhaps that will
make her feel better."</p>

<p>"And would you really like to have her
go instead of you?" said Mrs. Gray, looking
at Ninny's upturned face, and thinking
it was one of the sweetest faces she had
ever seen in her life.</p>

<p>"Yes'm, I should," said the little girl,
earnestly. "I can't bear to have her so
cross; and you can't bear it, either, mamma.
It almost makes you cry."</p>

<p>"But will she be pleasant if she goes to
ride?"</p>

<p>"I think so, mamma. You know she is
generally pleasant when she has her own
way."</p>

<p>And, indeed, Flaxie's little snarled-up
face smoothed in a moment when she heard
of the ride.</p>

<p>"I'll sit as still as a <i>possible</i> mouse,"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
said she, dancing about her mamma. "I
won't trouble papa one bit. Take off my
<i>sicking</i> dress, Ninny, and put on my rosy-posy
dress. Do it kick."</p>

<p>Was she sorry there was not room enough
for Ninny,&mdash;good Ninny, who did so much
to make her happy? O, no: Flaxie herself
was to have a fine time; and that was
all she thought about it.</p>

<p>"Let <i>me</i> hold the reins, Dr. Papa," said
she, as soon as she had climbed into the
carriage. "<i>I</i> can make the hossy go like
a tiger."</p>

<p>"You must sit between your mamma
and me, Mary Gray, and keep still; or I
shall take you back to the house," said
Dr. Papa, sternly.</p>

<p>"I <i>will</i> keep still," replied Miss Frizzle,
in alarm. "I'll keep as still as a possible
mouse!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span></p>

<p>The ride was a very pleasant one. The
bright dandelions were gone long ago; but
there were plenty of other flowers by the
roadside, and the birds in the trees sang
gaily.</p>

<p>"See 'em fly 'way off up! O Dr. Papa,
they touch the <i>ceiling</i> of the sky!" said
the "possible mouse."</p>

<p>When they reached the city, she wanted
to walk the streets by herself, but consented
to take her mother's hand. She
loved the many-colored windows and the
loud noises; but she was happiest of all,
when, at five o'clock, her father and
mother took her into an eating-saloon, and
called for a lunch.</p>

<p>She had never been in such a place before.</p>

<p>"I want some jelly and cake and pie
and puddin' and <i>every thing</i>," said Flaxie,
as her papa tapped the little bell.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span></p>

<p>"Dry toast for three; tea for two," said
Dr. Gray to the waiter.</p>

<p>"But <i>I</i> want some <i>nuts</i>," whispered
Flaxie, ready to cry. She meant doughnuts.</p>

<p>"Toast is all you can have," said Dr.
Papa, with one of his stern looks.</p>

<p>But Flaxie was a bold child, as well as
a bright one. She had seen her father
touch the bell and call a boy, and thought
she would do the same, and see what would
happen. Out went her little hand, <i>ting-a-ling</i>
went the silver bell, and up came the
same boy.</p>

<p>"<i>Nuts for one girl!</i>" cried Flaxie, before
her father had time to stop her.</p>

<p>The waiter covered his face with his
hand, and laughed; Mrs. Gray smiled; and
Dr. Gray tried to frown.</p>

<p>"Do let her have at least some jelly,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
Dr. Papa," pleaded the gentle mother.</p>

<p>"Well, I see you want to spoil her!
Yes, let her have some jelly," said her
father.</p>

<p>Ninny was sorry to see, the next day,
that this ride to New York had done Flaxie
Frizzle no good. The fact was, she had
caught cold, and was sick again for nearly
a week.</p>

<p>"My little sister has been having <i>conjunction</i>
of the lungs. I mean she came
pretty near it," said Preston to the boys.
He always made the most of it when any
thing ailed Flaxie; for he was rather
ashamed of belonging to such a healthy
family.</p>

<p>After this, the little girl was obliged to
stay in the house; and of course she made
everybody unhappy.</p>

<p>"<i>Why</i> can't I go ou' doors, mamma?"</p>

<p>"Because you have such a cold."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span></p>

<p>"Wish you never'd been <i>made</i>, mamma!"</p>

<p>"What a naughty, naughty girl," said
Ninny.</p>

<p>"It's my <i>mamma's</i> naughty! I'll have
to tell her a story," said the child. People
told stories to Flaxie when <i>she</i> was
naughty; why shouldn't she do the same
thing to other people when <i>they</i> were
naughty?</p>

<p>"Well," said she, folding her chubby
hands, and looking as severe as her father
did sometimes,&mdash;"Well, once there was a
little <i>good</i> girl, and her mother wanted her
to stay in the house all the days; and she
staid in the house and didn't go ou' doors;
and she <i>kep'</i> a-stayin' in the house. And
you s'pose what <i>'came</i> o' that little goorl?
She staid in the house, and staid in the
house; and in two weeks she <i>di-ed</i>!"</p>

<p>Mrs. Gray turned away suddenly; for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
Flaxie was spreading her hands and making
a grieved lip, as if she pitied the "good
goorl;" and it was really too funny.</p>

<p>"See, dear," said Grandma Pressy, "here
are some nice summer sweetings in my
work-bag. If you'll stay in the house
pleasantly, all the morning, you shall have
one."</p>

<p>Apples were rare, for it was early in the
season, and Flaxie looked delighted.</p>

<p>"I'll stay <i>velly</i> pleasantly," said she, and
ran into the kitchen for the chopping-tray,
in order to chop up a few of the animals
in her Noah's ark and "make some lion
hash for breakfast."</p>

<p>But, soon tiring of that, she came back
to the sitting-room, and looked wistfully
out of the window.</p>

<p>"Gamma," said she, "<i>O</i> gamma, mayn't
I have a <i>wormy</i> apple, and go ou' doors?"</p>

<p>Grandma Pressy laughed, and said,&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span></p>

<p>"I think I know of something that will
make you happy, little Mary. You just
go into the nursery and see what's there."</p>

<p>Flaxie went at once; and there, on the
rug, sat Lena Vigue, fondling a pretty Maltese
kitten. Lena was the washerwoman's
barefooted daughter; and she had just
brought the kitten in an old covered basket.</p>

<p>"O Lena, I didn't know you's here,"
said Miss Frizzle, dropping her "lion hash"
in a chair. "I'm glad you bringed your
kitty."</p>

<p>"It's <i>your</i> kitty now," sighed Lena. "I've
got to leave it here."</p>

<p>"<i>My</i> kitty?" cried Flaxie, clapping her
hands.</p>

<p>"Yes; your mamma asked me to fetch it.
She told me she'd give me te-en cents if
I'd fetch it," said Lena, who always spoke
with a drawl.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span></p>

<p>Flaxie danced for joy.</p>

<p>"There, I knew you'd be happy now,
Flaxie Frizzle," said Ninny, who stood
anxiously looking on.</p>

<p>"I hope the <i>kitty</i>'ll be happy," sighed
Lena, who thought that was far more important.
"I hope you'll feed it well; it's
used to it," she added, a little proudly.</p>

<p>"O, yes, what do you feed it with?"
asked Ninny.</p>

<p>"<i>Sour milk</i>," drawled the little French
girl.</p>

<p>"I never heard of sour milk for a cat,"
said Ninny, when Lena had left; "but
perhaps this is a French cat."</p>

<p>"At any rate we'll try sweet milk first,"
said Mrs. Gray, smiling.</p>

<p>"See, she likes it, mamma," cried Flaxie,
stroking the pretty creature. "See her
drink it out of her tongue."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span></p>

<p>Ninny and her mother looked at each
other and smiled, as if to say,&mdash;</p>

<p>"How glad we both are to have Flaxie
happy for a little while."</p>

<p>But it did not last long. Preston, who
was always setting traps for rats and mice
and foxes, set a dreadful one in the shed,
and caught the kitty, which of course had
to be killed. Preston was in great distress
about it.</p>

<p>"There, Frizzy-me-gig, <i>don't</i> cry. John
Piper is going to give me something a
great deal better than a kitten."</p>

<p>"What is it? O, what is it?"</p>

<p>"You'll see when I get it."</p>

<p>"Will it be my owny-dony?"</p>

<p>"No-o, not <i>yours</i> exactly; but you may
look at it and touch it."</p>

<p>Flaxie was a little comforted; for now
she must try to guess what it could be that
was better than a kitten.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span></p>




<p class="ph2" style="margin-top: 1em; margin-bottom: 1em;"><a name="ChV." id="ChV.">V.</a></p>

<p class="ph3">BETTER THAN A KITTEN.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> next day, Preston and his grandfather
rode away after old Slowboy.</p>

<p>"They might have let me gone, too, <i>I</i>
should fink," grumbled Flaxie. "What they
goin' to get in that basket? Tell me,
Ninny."</p>

<p>"Something nice that you never saw
before," replied Ninny.</p>

<p>When they came home that night, they
brought two things that made Miss Frizzle's
eyes dance and sparkle like stars. Curled
up together in a soft heap were two beautiful
rabbits,&mdash;one brown, the other snow-white.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span></p>

<p>John Piper, a man who had once lived
at Mr. Abbott's, had given these rabbits to
Preston Gray and Bert Abbott, for their
own. It was very kind of him; but he
made one mistake&mdash;he forgot to say which
of the boys should have the white rabbit.
The brown one was "very respectable," as
Ninny said; but the other was lovely&mdash;as
plump and white as a snowball, with pink
eyes that glowed like gems.</p>

<p>"Poh, who cares which is which?" said
Bert.</p>

<p>"I'm sure <i>I</i> don't," said Preston, as he
hunted all over the stable for an old rabbit
cage Crawford had brought there last
year. "If we keep 'em together it's all
the same."</p>

<p>The boys were well satisfied for awhile;
but no more so than Flaxie. After saying
her "big prayer," she added,&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span></p>

<p>"O God, we thank Thee <i>specially</i> for
the <i>wabbits</i>; all but the cage; we had that
before."</p>

<p>Her cold was well by this time; and she
was allowed to stay in the yard as much
as she chose, and watch the pretty pets.
It was a funny sight to see them nibble
the vegetables their little masters brought
them; and Flaxie stood and threw kisses to
make their dinner all the sweeter.</p>

<p>As the cage was Preston's, and kept in
his mother's clothes-yard, it followed that
Preston saw more of the rabbits, and had
more care of them than Bert. But, alas,
Flaxie had the care of them too! When
Preston was gone to school, she hovered
around them, saying to herself,&mdash;</p>

<p>"I mustn't lose these wabbits. It isn't
<i>my</i> wabbits. If I should lose 'em, I should
be <i>'spised</i>; and, when I grow up a woman,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
then folks will look to me and say, 'Flaxie,
<i>where's</i> those wabbits?'"</p>

<p>And, saying this, she let them out of the
cage. A little while afterward, a cruel dog
leaped over the fence, worried the poor
timid things half to death, and, before
Preston could get them back into the cage,
had bitten off the beautiful white rabbit's
white tail.</p>

<p>It was too much! Preston was very
angry, not with Flaxie, but with the
dog, and gave him a good beating; or it
would have been a good beating if it had
only hit the dog! But, after the first blow,
the naughty beast ran around a corner; and
that was the last seen of him, though it
was not the last said or thought of him,
you may be sure.</p>

<p>Both the boys were grieved at sight of
their white rabbit without any tail, and
Bert said,&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span></p>

<p>"Flaxie, what did you open the cage
for?"</p>

<p>But she replied, with an injured air,&mdash;</p>

<p>"You ought to not <i>lemme</i> open the cage,&mdash;such
a little goorl as me."</p>

<p>And Bert laughed, but could not help
remarking to Preston,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Sure enough, you're a smart boy to let
that young one meddle round so much."</p>

<p>Then Preston had to answer,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Well, I didn't s'pose she could turn
the button, and you know I didn't; and I
wish you'd hush up."</p>

<p>Naturally, when Bert was told to "hush
up," he only talked so much the more; and
we all know that talking only makes matters
worse.</p>

<p>"If that dog had bit old Brownie, I
wouldn't have cared," said Bert, trying to
be provoking; "but <i>my</i> white rabbit! I say
it's a shame!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span></p>

<p>"<i>Your</i> white rabbit? What you talking
about?"</p>

<p>"Why, John Piper was <i>my</i> father's hired
man, sir; and you're only my cousin."</p>

<p>"Well, what o' that, sir? Isn't this
cage mine? And would he have given the
rabbits to us <i>without</i> a cage? No, <i>sir</i>: if
it hadn't been for <i>me</i> you wouldn't have
had <i>half</i> a rabbit, Bert Abbott!"</p>

<p>"Half a Bert Rabbit Abbott!" stuttered
Flaxie, who never let any one be cross to
her brother, except herself.</p>

<p>Then the words flew like hailstones,&mdash;pell-mell,
sharp and thick, without mercy,&mdash;till
the boys forgot that they had ever
loved each other.</p>

<p>The very next day Brownie got her foot
caught in one of Preston's fox-traps, and
was lamed for life. Bert had scorned to
call her his own when she was a perfect<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
rabbit; but now, out of spite, he hunted
up an old bird-cage, and went in great
haste to claim her, before she got "killed
dead." He said he "didn't care a cent
about the old brown thing, but he wasn't
going to have her abused."</p>

<p>"Good riddance!" cried Preston. "<i>I</i>
don't want to see her again."</p>

<p>"<i>We</i> don't like yabbits, any but white
ones," said Flaxie, keeping back her tears
with a mighty effort, for she dearly loved
Brownie.</p>

<p>"O, yes, Preston Gray, you feel mighty
smart because you've got the white one,"
retorted Bert, in a rage; "but she won't do
you much good, now I tell you! You see
if something or another don't happen to her,
that's all!"</p>

<p>Considering the bad luck that seemed to
hang over Preston's things,&mdash;from his living<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
pets down to his kites and marbles,&mdash;it
was very likely something would happen
to the white rabbit; and Mrs. Gray told
her husband she "trembled for Snowball."</p>

<hr class="chap" />
<div class="figcenter" style="width: 420px;">
<img src="images/image3.jpg" width="420" height="579" alt="Better than a Kitten. Page 68." />
</div>
<p class="center" style="margin-top: 1em;"><span class="smcap">Better than a Kitten</span>. Page 68.</p>
<hr class="chap" />

<p>Very soon after this Preston rushed into
the house one morning in great trouble,
his lips quivering.</p>

<p>"Something ails Snowball," gasped he;
"she's fainting away."</p>

<p>Fainting away! She was dying, and
nobody could save her. All that could be
done was to watch her graceful form stiffen
in death, while everybody asked over and
over, "What could have killed her?"</p>

<p>"She was poisoned," said Dr. Gray.</p>

<p>"O, O!" screamed Preston, beside himself
with grief. "Then Bert did it! Bert
<i>must</i> have done it; and I'll never forgive
him as long as I live!"</p>

<p>"My son, my son! Never let me hear
you speak in that way of your cousin."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span></p>

<p>But Preston muttered to Ninny and
Julia,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Why, you see, I <i>know</i> he did it! He
said something would happen to Snowball;
and he said it so spiteful!"</p>

<p>"Bertie Rabbit's a drefful wicked boy,
an' his playfings shan't stay in <i>my</i> yard,"
scolded Flaxie Frizzle, kicking away, with
her foot, Bert's new green morocco ball
that lay in the grass.</p>

<p>"Look there, will you! He dropped
that ball when he brought the poison,"
cried Preston, very much excited. "Give
that ball here to me, Flaxie".</p>

<p>Preston was sure now. He had made up
his mind in a hurry, but he had made it
up; he <i>knew</i> who had killed his rabbit.</p>

<p>Bert was not at school that day.</p>

<p>"I didn't <i>s'pose</i> he'd dare to come,"
said Preston.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span></p>

<p>Then he took the ball out of his pocket,
looked at it savagely, and told the boys
what Bertie had done.</p>

<p>Everybody was sorry, for Preston was a
great favorite; but it is a grave fact that
a few of the boys were secretly glad of a
quarrel between two such good friends,
and thought, "Now Preston will notice
the rest of us a little more perhaps." And
the boys who had these envious feelings
did not try to stand up for Bert, you may
be sure. They said, "You ain't a bit to
blame for getting mad, Preston. It's pretty
plain who killed your rabbit. Wonder how
Bert Abbott'd like it if you should give
a sling at Old Brownie? 'Twould be no
more'n fair!"</p>

<p>"That's so," said Preston, growing angrier
and angrier, as they talked over his wrongs,
till it seemed to him he couldn't stand it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
another minute without revenging himself
on Bert.</p>

<p>"If he kills my rabbit, why shouldn't
I kill his?" he argued with himself, stealing
round by Aunt Jane Abbott's on his way
home from school at noon.</p>

<p>Just before he reached her back gate, he
picked up a smooth round stone and aimed
it at a knot in one of the boards, which he
hit right in the centre,&mdash;he was pretty
sure to hit whatever he aimed at,&mdash;then
he found the stone again, and hid it in his
pocket. It was about the right size to
throw at a rabbit's head.</p>

<p>Poor, unsuspecting Brownie! There she
was, in the garden, munching cabbage-leaves,
when Preston crept toward her,
looking this way and that, to make sure
nobody saw him. She heard the slight
sound of his boots, and sat up on her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
haunches, perfectly motionless, to listen.
Certainly he never could have had a better
chance to aim at her than then. Very
slowly he put his hand in his pocket, and
very slowly he was drawing out the stone,
when the loving little creature caught sight
of him, and leaped joyfully toward him in
her pitiful, crippled way. What boy, with
a heart, would have harmed such a pet?
Not Preston, I hope you know! He
dropped the stone, and ran home in such a
hurry that he was quite out of breath,
when at the gate he met Flaxie, carrying
Snowball's drinking-dish by the tips of her
fingers.</p>

<p>"Naughty old <i>fing</i>" said she; "I'm
going to frow it down the <i>scut-hole</i>!"
(Flaxie meant scuttle.)</p>

<p>"Hold on, that's mine!" cried Preston,
seizing the pan which he had painted a brilliant
green only a day or two before.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span></p>

<p>"No, no: I'm going to frow it down the
scut-hole," persisted Flaxie. "It killed the
dear little rabbit: Dr. Papa said so."</p>

<p>Yes: it was the fresh paint that had
poisoned Snowball. Dr. Gray had said
that at once when Flaxie had led him out
to the cage to show him the poor, stiff little
body, and he saw the flakes of green
soaked off from the sides of the drinking-pan
and floating on the water.</p>

<p>So really Preston was the murderer.
Poor Preston! Didn't he hang his head for
shame? And, as for Bert, he hadn't been
near Snowball for two whole days; he
had been on the sofa all that time with
earache and toothache.</p>

<p>"Does you feel orfly?" said little Flaxie.
"You going to cry?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I feel orfly; but boys don't cry,"
replied Preston, trying to whistle.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span></p>

<p>He tried to whistle again, when Bert, of
his own accord, brought back Brownie and
said,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Come, Pres, let's go partner's again.
Your cage is better than mine."</p>

<p>Preston choked up and could not speak;
but, after this, he and Bert were closer
friends than ever.</p>

<p class="ph2" style="margin-top: 1em; margin-bottom: 1em;"><a name="ChVI." id="ChVI.">VI.</a></p>

<p class="ph3">THE STRANGE RIDE.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> next summer Flaxie had a baby
brother named Philip Lally Gray. Flaxie
said he was "as good as any of the rest
of the family, and lots better."</p>

<p>She loved him dearly; and perhaps it was
in loving him that she learned to become
unselfish. By the time he was a year old,
he had pulled her hair, and scratched her
face, and given her a great deal of trouble;
but the more he tried her patience, the
more her patience grew.</p>

<p>"Really, she is almost as sweet as Ninny,"
said Mrs. Gray to her husband.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span></p>

<p>When Philip was thirteen months old, he
had no teeth, and Flaxie grieved about it.
Her own were falling out, and she wished
she could give them to her baby brother.</p>

<p>"Never mind," said Dr. Papa. "If he
never has any teeth of his own, I will buy
him some gold ones."</p>

<p>"O, that'll be so nice," cried Flaxie. "I
never saw any gold teeth in all my life."</p>

<p>That year, late in September, Flaxie
Frizzle went with her mamma and baby
Phil to the city of Louisville, in Kentucky,
to see Grandpa and Grandma Curtis. Dr.
Gray staid at home with Ninny and Preston.</p>

<p>"Poor papa couldn't come, 'cause he has
to give folks their mederson," explained
Miss Frizzle, before she had taken off her
bonnet in grandma's parlor.</p>

<p>"Too bad," laughed pretty Grandma<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
Curtis, who was ever and ever so much
younger than Grandma Pressy, and didn't
even wear a cap. "But we are glad he
could send his little daughter."</p>

<p>No wonder she was glad! Flaxie was
all pink and white, with a mouth made up
for kisses, and eyes laughing like the sky
after a shower. The colored girl, Venus,
had never seen her before; but she loved
her in a moment, for Flaxie threw both
arms around her neck and kissed her, like
a butterfly alighting on a black velvet
rose.</p>

<p>But that night Flaxie did not seem quite
well, and the next morning she was worse;
she could not even hold the baby.</p>

<p>"They're so glad I've got the mumps,"
said she, two or three days afterward, as
she lay on the sofa, with hot, swelled
cheeks and parched lips that tried to
smile.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span></p>

<p>The remark was made to Peppermint
Drop, the doll of her bosom; but black
Venus took it to herself.</p>

<p>"And what makes 'em glad you're sick?"
said she.</p>

<p>"'Cause my mamma wants me to have
the mumps all done, Venus, and then she
can go to my <i>'nother</i> grandma's next week.
I've got lots of grandmas. She's going to
see this one next week, and take the
baby."</p>

<p>"Yes," said Venus, dusting the chairs;
"and prob'ly if you get well she'll take
you too."</p>

<p>"No, O, no: she don't think's best," replied
Flaxie, dropping a hot tear on Peppermint
Drop's bosom, which would have
melted it a little if it had been made of
sugar instead of bran. "Grandma Hyde
lives in the <i>other</i> town, 'way off, down<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
where the boats go; and mamma says she
<i>can't</i> take but one childrens. She's drefful
sorry; but she don't think best."</p>

<p>And the little girl dried her eyes on her
doll's bib-apron; for she heard some one
coming, and didn't want to be a baby.</p>

<p>It was mamma, with Phil in her arms,
fresh from his morning bath, bright, wide-awake,
and ready for mischief. His hair
was golden,&mdash;darker even now than
Flaxie's,&mdash;and his eyes were the richest
brown.</p>

<p>"Shall I let him <i>go</i>?" asked mamma, as
if he were a wild creature, and they generally
kept him in chains.</p>

<p>"Yes, mamma, let him go."</p>

<p>And, when she dropped her hold of him,
he rushed at his sister, and "hugged her
grizzly," as she called it, like the most
affectionate of little bears.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span></p>

<p>"Won't Grandma Hyde be <i>exprised</i> to
see him? She'll love you and thank you
dearly," said Flaxie.</p>

<p>"I'm a little ashamed of him," laughed
Mrs. Gray. "You know he has only one
tooth."</p>

<p>"Well, he hasn't much teeth, and he
can't talk; but he can stand on his head
<i>so</i> cunnin'! Phil want to go in boat?
Want see Gamma Hyde, and hug her
grizzly?"</p>

<p>Was this our cross Flaxie? Indeed, she
<i>was</i> almost as sweet as Ninny&mdash;sometimes!</p>

<p>When the day came for going to Shawneetown,
where Grandma Hyde lived, Flaxie
had got her mumps "all done," and was
allowed to ride down in a hack to the
"Jennie Howell," and see mamma off.</p>

<p>Little Phil wore a white dress and a soft<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
white cloak, with silk acorns and leaves
embroidered all over it; and a white cap
with a white cockade set on top of his
gold rings of hair. He looked like a
prince; and his mother called him, "'Philip,
my King.'"</p>

<p>The last thing Flaxie saw him do was
to throw kisses at a hen-coop which somebody
was putting on board the boat. He
thought there were chickens in it, and I
suppose there were.</p>

<p>Flaxie looked rather sober as she rode
back in the hack with Grandma Curtis.
"He never went to <i>Shawtown</i> before," said
she; "and he isn't much 'quainted with
strangers. I spect I ought to gone with
him."</p>

<p>"I spect he'll get along beautifully," replied
Grandma Curtis, hugging Flaxie;
"but, if you are needed, your mamma can
send a dispatch, you know."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span></p>

<p>She little thought Mrs. Gray would really
send a dispatch.</p>

<p>Mrs. Gray and the baby steamed slowly
down the Ohio,&mdash;very slowly; for the
water was so low that in many places you
could see the bottom of the river. Once
the boat stuck fast for an hour or two on
a sand-bar.</p>

<p>"I am glad it is not a snag," thought
Mrs. Gray; "that would make me afraid."</p>

<p>A snag is a dead tree; and, when the
river is low, it sometimes scrapes the bottom
of the boat, and makes holes in it.</p>

<p>After supper she undressed Philly and
put him in his little berth; for they were
not likely to reach Shawneetown, at this
rate, before morning.</p>

<p>"They are all longing to see us,"
thought Mrs. Gray, kissing her sleeping
baby. Mrs. Hyde was her own mother,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
and they had not met for two years. "O,
yes, Philly, your grandma has a nice supper
ready, and your Aunt Floy has been
at the window all the afternoon. How
slowly we do go. Hush, Philly, don't
cry,&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'The owl and the pussy cat went to sea,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In a beautiful pea-green boat.'"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Philly dropped off to sleep at last. His
mother put him in the upper berth, and
lay down herself on the lower berth, without
undressing. She was quiet and happy,
listening to the baby's breathing, and thinking
of the griddle-cakes and honey grandma
would give her for breakfast, when suddenly
she was roused by frightful screams.</p>

<p>The boat was leaking! A great snag,
which stood up in the river like a horned
beast, had seized it and torn holes in its
sides. It was of no use trying to stop the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
leak; the boat was sinking fast; all that
could be done was to get out the people.</p>

<p>The captain and his men worked terribly,
taking them off into life-boats; but
there was such a hurry and such a fright
that it was not possible to save everybody.
Some of the passengers went down. Among
them were some bewildered little children,
who did not know what had happened till
they woke in heaven, and the angels told
them the story.</p>

<p>Mrs. Gray was one of the people saved;
but where was her precious baby? The
men said they did not know, he was
nowhere to be seen, and even his little bed
had been washed away!</p>

<p>"Go without Philly? Go without my
baby? I can't do it, I <i>can't</i> do it," cried
the poor mother.</p>

<p>But two of the good men seized her and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
dragged her into the life-boat. They <i>would</i>
save her in spite of herself.</p>

<p>Dear Mrs. Gray, who had thought so
much of seeing her mother and sister, and
showing them her baby! She was taken
in a carriage with the other passengers to
Shawneetown, just where she had all the
time intended to go; but, O, what a sad
meeting! Her mother and her sister Floy
met her at the door, not knowing what
had happened.</p>

<p>"My baby is lost, my baby is lost!"
wailed she, and fainted away in Aunt
Kitty's arms.</p>

<p>A dispatch was sent to Grandma Curtis
at Louisville, and another to Dr. Gray at
Rosewood, New York. The poor doctor
was wakened in the middle of the night to
learn that his little boy was drowned!</p>

<p>Morning came at last; it always comes.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
The sun shone too; it is just as likely to
shine when people are sad as when they
are happy. But what a long day it was
to that wretched mother! What a long
day to her husband, who started before
sunrise to go to meet her!</p>

<p>In the evening, before Dr. Gray could
possibly get there, a strange man called at
Grandma Hyde's and asked if Mrs. Gray
was in the house?</p>

<p>"She is," replied Aunt Floy, whose eyes
were red with weeping. "I hope you
haven't any more bad news for her! She
can't bear any more!"</p>

<p>"I don't believe it's bad news," replied
the man, with something that was almost a
smile. "Did Mrs. Gray lose a child on the
wreck of the 'Jennie Howell' last night?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir, a baby. Speak low."</p>

<p>"Well," said the man, dropping his voice<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
to a whisper, "I am pilot of the 'Jennie
Howell,' ma'am. I went down to look at
her this morning; and what should I see
but a mattress, ma'am, floating in the
cabin, most up to the ceiling, and a live
baby on top of it!"</p>

<p>"A live baby? O, not a <i>live</i> baby!"</p>

<p>"Yes, ma'am, sleeping as sweet as a
lamb! My wife has got him now over here
to the hotel&mdash;a pretty little yellow-haired
shaver, as&mdash;"</p>

<p>"O, it's Philly! where is he? Bring him
this minute! I know it's Philly!"</p>

<p>And so it was; for, my dears, this is a
true story. It was Philip Gray; and he
had been saved almost by a miracle. Was
the finding of Moses in the bulrushes so
strange a thing as this?</p>

<p>His mother was driven to the hotel,
where the pilot's wife sat in the public
parlor with a baby in her lap.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span></p>

<p>"O, my boy!" cried Mrs. Gray.</p>

<p>And he rushed into her arms with a
gleeful shout,&mdash;her own precious "'Philip
my King.'"</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span></p>




<p class="ph2" style="margin-top: 1em; margin-bottom: 1em;"><a name="ChVII." id="ChVII.">VII.</a></p>

<p class="ph3">MAKING CALLS.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Not</span> very long after this, Mrs. Gray,
came back to Rosewood with Flaxie and
the dear rescued baby whom everybody
was eager to see, for,&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i6">"They loved him more and more.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ah, never in their hearts before,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Was love so lovely born."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>And Ninny cried as she took him in her
arms, and said,&mdash;</p>

<p>"He doesn't look as he used to, does
he, papa? His eyes are <i>very</i> different."</p>

<p>"You think that because we came so
near losing him," replied Dr. Papa.</p>

<p>Baby Philip looked round upon them all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
with "those deep and tender twilight eyes,"
which seemed to be full of sweet meanings;
but I must confess that he was
thinking of nothing in the world just then
but his supper.</p>

<p>The travellers had not been home a
week before Grandpa Pressy sent for Ninny
to go and make him and grandma a visit,
and this left Flaxie Frizzle rather lonesome;
for Preston did not care to play with girls
when he could be with Bert Abbott. Besides,
he and his cousin Bert were uncommonly
busy about this time, getting up a
pin-show in Dr. Gray's barn.</p>

<p>So Flaxie's mamma often let her run
over to Aunt Jane Abbott's to see Lucy
and Rose. I have not told you before of
these cousins, because there have been so
many other things to talk about that I
have not had time. Lucy was a black-eyed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
little gipsy, and Rose was a sweet
little creature, you could never see without
wanting to kiss.</p>

<p>Just now Aunt Jane had a lively young
niece from Albany spending the fall with
her, named Gussie Ricker. One day,
when Flaxie Frizzle was at Aunt Jane's,
Gussie proposed that Flaxie and Lucy
should make a call upon a little girl who
was visiting Mrs. Prim.</p>

<p>"O, yes," said Lucy, "we truly must call
on Dovey Sparrow. She has frizzly curls
like Flaxie's, and she can play five tunes
on the piano. But, Gussie, how do you
make calls?"</p>

<p>"O," replied Miss Gussie, with a twinkle
in her eye, "all sorts of ways. Sometimes
we take our cards; but it isn't really necessary
for little girls to do that. Then we
just touch the lady's hand,&mdash;this way,&mdash;and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
talk about the weather; and, in three
minutes or so, we go away."</p>

<p>"I've seen calls a great many times,"
said Flaxie Frizzle, thoughtfully. "I can
make one if Lucy will go with me."</p>

<p>"I could make one better alone," said
Lucy, in a very cutting tone. She was two
years older than Flaxie, and always remembered
it.</p>

<p>"I'll go wiv you, Flaxie, if Lucy doesn't,"
put in little Rose, the sweet wee sister; and
then it was Flaxie's turn to be cutting, for
as it happened she was just two years older
than Rose.</p>

<p>"Poh," said she; "<i>you</i> can't do calls, a
little speck of a thing like you! You don't
grow so much in a year as my thumb grows
in five minutes!"</p>

<p>Rose hid her blushing face in the rocking-chair.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span></p>

<p>"Do you truly think we'd better go,
Gussie?" asked Lucy; for Gussie was laughing,
and Lucy did not like to be made
fun of, though she did make fun of Flaxie
Frizzle.</p>

<p>"O, certainly," said Gussie, trying to
look very sober; "don't I always say what
I mean?"</p>

<p>So, as they were going, Lucy took Flaxie
one side that afternoon and instructed her
how to behave.</p>

<p>"Dovey came from Boston, and we never
saw her only in church; so I s'pose we
<i>must</i> carry cards."</p>

<p>"Where'll we get 'em?"</p>

<p>"O, my mamma has plenty, and so has
Gussie. I know Gussie would be glad to
lend me her silver card-case that Uncle
William gave her; she wants me to be so
polite! But I don't dare ask her, so I
guess I'll borrow it without asking."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span></p>

<p>"Hasn't somebody else got a gold one
that <i>I</i> could borrow?" asked Miss Frizzle,
looking rather unhappy as the pretty toy
dropped into Lucy's pocket.</p>

<p>"O, it's no matter about <i>you</i>; you don't
need a card-case, for I shall be with you
to take care of you," returned Lucy, as
they both stood in Mrs. Abbott's guest-chamber
before the tall looking-glass. "Do
tell me, Flaxie, does my hat look polite?
I mean is it style enough?"</p>

<p>"It's as style as mine," replied Flaxie,
gazing into the glass with Lucy. How
pretty she thought Lucy was, because her
eyes were black and her hair was dark
and didn't "friz!"</p>

<p>"I wish I wasn't a 'tow-head,' and I
wish I was as tall as you!" sighed she.</p>

<p>"Well, <i>you</i> don't care," said Lucy, graciously.
"You'll grow.  You're just as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
good as I am if you only behave well.
You mustn't run out your tongue, Flaxie:
it looks as if you were catching flies.
And you mustn't sneeze before people: it's
very rude."</p>

<p>"I heard <i>you</i> once, Lu Abbott, and it
was in church too!"</p>

<p>"O, then 'twas an accident; you must
scuse accidents. And now," added Lucy,
giving a final touch to her gloves, "I
want you to notice how I act, Flaxie
Frizzle, and do just the same; for my
mother has seen the President and yours
hasn't."</p>

<p>"Well, my mamma's seen an elephant,"
exclaimed Flaxie, with spirit; "and she has
two silk dresses and a smelling-bottle."</p>

<p>"Poh! my cousin Gussie's got a gold
watch, and some nightly blue sirreup.
Uncle William gives her lots of things;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
but I shouldn't think of telling o' that!
Now, do you know what to do when anybody
<i>induces</i> you to strangers?"</p>

<p>"What you s'pose?" replied Flaxie, tartly.
"I speak up and say 'Yes'm.'"</p>

<p>Lucy laughed, as if she were looking
down, down from a great hight upon her
little cousin.</p>

<p>"And shake hands, too," added Flaxie,
quickly, for fear she had made a mistake.</p>

<p>"No, you give three fingers, <i>not</i> your
hand. Just as if you were touching a toad.
And you raise your eyebrows up,&mdash;<i>this</i> way,&mdash;and
quirk your mouth,&mdash;so,&mdash;and nod
your head.</p>

<p>"'How d'ye do, Miss Dovey Sparrow?
It's a charr-rming day. Are they all well at
Boston?' You'll see how <i>I'll</i> do it, Flaxie!
Then I shall take out my hang-verchief
and shake it, so the sniff of the nightly blue<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
sirreup will <i>waft</i> all round the room.&mdash;O,
I've seen 'em!</p>

<p>"Then I shall wipe my nose&mdash;this way&mdash;and
sit down. I've seen young ladies
do it a great many times."</p>

<p>"So've I," chimed in Flaxie Frizzle, admiring
her cousin's fine graces. Such tiptoeing
and courtesying and waving of hands
before the looking-glass. How did Lucy
manage it so well?</p>

<p>"And, if people have plants," continued
Lucy, "then you say, '<i>How</i> flagrant!'
And, if people have children, you say,
'<i>What</i> darlings!' and pat their hair, and
ask, 'Do you go to school, my dear?'"</p>

<p>"They've said that to me ever so many
times; and I've got real sick of it," remarked
Flaxie.</p>

<p>"And they keep calling every thing
char-ar-ming and bee-you-oo-tiful! with such<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
tight gloves on, I know their fingers feel
choked!"</p>

<p>"I spect we ought to go," said Flaxie,
tired of all this instruction. "I don't believe
you know how to behave, Lu Abbott.
You never made any calls, more'n I did."</p>

<p>As they went through the hall, Flaxie
thought she would "borrow" Aunt Jane's
lace veil; but Lucy did not observe this till
they had started off. They tripped along
the roadside, past Mr. Potter's store, past
the church, their feet scarcely touching the
grass. Lucy felt like a princess royal till
they reached Mrs. Prim's beautiful grounds,
and then her heart fluttered a little. She
had a sudden longing to run home and get
Gussie to come back with them.</p>

<p>"Pull the bell," said she to Flaxie.
Flaxie pulled so hard that her veil flew
off, and she had to chase it several rods.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span></p>

<p>"Put it in your pocket, you awful child,"
exclaimed Lucy, as Kitty Maloney, the
kitchen girl, opened the door in alarm,
thinking something dreadful had happened.</p>

<p>"Why, bless my soul, if 'tisn't Docther
Gray's little snip of a Mary. And who's
this? Why, it's Miss Abbott's little gee-url.
Anybody sick?"</p>

<p>Now was the time for Miss Frizzle's
courage to come up. She stepped in front
of the frightened Lucy, and exclaimed,
boldly,&mdash;</p>

<p>"I'm Flaxie Frizzle, you know, and this
is my cousin. We want to see Dovey
Sparrow."</p>

<p>As Flaxie spoke, Lucy tremblingly drew
out her card-case.</p>

<p>"Yes, she's in. She and Miss Prim has
just come from ridin'. Will ye walk in?"
said Katy, <i>very</i> respectfully.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span></p>

<p>"Please give her these," faltered Lucy,
placing in Kitty's hands two cards, one
bearing the name, "Augusta L. Ricker," the
other a few words in pencil, which somebody
must have written for a memorandum:&mdash;</p>

<p>
"Kerosene oil.<br />
Vanilla.<br />
Oatmeal soap."<br />
</p>

<p>Kitty stared at the cards, then at the
exquisite Lucy, and suddenly put her calico
apron up to her face.</p>

<p>"Will ye wait till I give her the kee-ards,
young ladies, or will ye come in the parlor
now?" said she, in a stifled voice.</p>

<p>Flaxie Frizzle concluded to walk in; and
Lucy, who was now nothing but Flaxie's
shadow, followed her in silence.</p>

<p>Kitty Maloney disappeared; and, in about
a minute, Dovey Sparrow tripped in, blushing
and looking as frightened as a wood-pigeon.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
The roguish Kitty had just told
her that her little visitors were very ginteel
folks, and she must talk to 'em as if she
was reading it out of a book.</p>

<p>Meantime Kitty was hiding in the back
parlor, with her apron over her mouth, forgetting
her potato yeast in her curiosity to
watch these fine young ladies.</p>

<p>Flaxie rose and shook hands, but entirely
forgot to speak. Lucy did the same.</p>

<p>"H'm," said Flaxie, snapping the card-case,
which she had taken from Lucy.</p>

<p>"Yes'm," responded Dovey, trembling.</p>

<p>It was getting rather awkward.</p>

<p>Flaxie wiped her nose, and so did Miss
Lucy. Then Flaxie folded her arms; also
Lucy.</p>

<p>Poor Miss Dovey tried to think of a
speech grand enough to make to these wise
little people; but the poor thing could not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
remember any thing but her geography lessons.</p>

<p>Flaxie Frizzle was also laboring in vain.
The only thing that came into <i>her</i> head
was a wild desire to sneeze.</p>

<p>At last, her eye chancing to rest on the
crimson trimmings of Dovey's dress, she
was suddenly reminded of turkeys and
their dislike of red things. So she cried
out in despair,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Do you keep a turkey at your house?"</p>

<p>O, strange question!</p>

<p>"Does your papa keep sheep?" chimed
in Lucy.</p>

<p>"We don't keep a thing!" replied
Dovey, in great surprise at these remarkable
speeches; "nor a dog either."</p>

<p>Then Flaxie Frizzle, growing bolder and
bolder, came out brilliantly with this:&mdash;</p>

<p>"You got any <i>trundlebeds</i> to Boston?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span></p>

<p>This was too much; the ice was beginning
to crack.</p>

<p>"Why, Flaxie Frizzle!" said Lucy; and
then she laughed.</p>

<p>"Look at that clock on the bracket!
Why, what are you laughing at, girls?"</p>

<p>"O, how funny!" cried Flaxie Frizzle,
dancing out of her chair.</p>

<p>"Do stop making me shake so!" said
Miss Dovey, dropping to the floor, and
rocking back and forth.</p>

<p>"O, ho," screamed Lucy, hopping across
the rug, "you don't look like a bird any
more'n I do, Dovey Sparrow."</p>

<p>They were all set in a very high gale
by this time.</p>

<p>"Be still," said Flaxie Frizzle, holding
up both hands. "There, now, I had a
sneeze; but, O, dear, I can't sneeze it!"</p>

<p>"You're just like anybody, after all,"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
tittered the sparrow. "Don't you want to
go out and jump on the hay?"</p>

<p>"Well, there," replied Miss Lucy, rolling
her gloves into a ball, "you never asked
us to take our things off, you never!"</p>

<p>"I didn't want you to," said Dovey;
"you scared me half to death!"</p>

<p>"Did we?" cried Lucy, in delight.
"Well, I never was so 'fraid my own self.
You ought to heard my heart beat when
we rang that bell."</p>

<p>"Me, too," said Flaxie Frizzle.</p>

<p>"But you're such a darling, though," pursued
Lucy, kissing her new friend warmly.
"I'm <i>glad</i> you don't know how to behave!"</p>

<p>"I'm glad you don't, either," said Dovey,
tilting herself on a rocker like a bird on a
bough, "I thought you were going to be,
<i>O</i>, so polite, for you set Kitty all of a
tremble. Come, let's go out and play."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span></p>

<p>"So we will. Come along, Flaxie Frizzle."</p>

<p>"What! is that Flaxie Frizzle? O, I
always did want to see Flaxie Frizzle.
Mrs. Prim has told me lots about her,"
said Dovey, as they skipped out to the
barn.</p>

<p>You may be sure Lucy lost the "borrowed"
card-case in the hay; and, when it
was found, weeks afterward, it bore the
marks of horse's teeth; but Gussie said,&mdash;</p>

<p>"It is good enough for me; I ought not
to have filled the children's heads with such
nonsense."</p>

<p>I am happy to state that Aunt Jane's
veil,&mdash;a beautiful lace one,&mdash;reached home
safely, and that this was the last fashionable
call Lucy and Flaxie Frizzle ever
made.</p>

<p class="ph3">TEASING MIDGE.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Sometime</span> after this, Aunt Jane Abbott,
who was sick with neuralgia, went to New
Jersey for her health. She took Bert and
Lucy with her; but little Rose came to
stay with Flaxie Frizzle. Rose was her
real name, but sometimes they called her
Midge, she was so small.</p>

<p>She was a sweet child; and, the first day
she came, Miss Frizzle was so glad to see
her that she called for her new tea-set,
which stood on the high shelf in the closet,
took her best wax doll out of its paper
wraps, and held a real jubilee in the nursery.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span></p>

<p>"O, Rosie," said she, dancing around
her, "I wish you'd never, never go home
again, only just long enough to see your
mother, and come right back again to live
in this house. 'Cause I haven't any little
sister, you know, 'cept Ninny, and she's
big,&mdash;'most twelve years old."</p>

<p>"Well, my mamma's got the <i>algebra</i>;
and I've come to stay a great, long while,"
said Rosa, seating herself at the doll's
table,&mdash;"all the time mamma and Lucy
are gone."</p>

<p>"What do you say your mamma's got?"</p>

<p>"<i>Algebra.</i>"</p>

<p>"You mean <i>new-algery</i>," said Flaxie,
smiling.</p>

<p>"Well, I guess it is," returned meek
little Rose, passing a wee plate to her
cousin. "And now you say to me, 'Won't
you have some tea, lady?'"</p>

<hr class="chap" />
<div class="figcenter" style="width: 420px;">

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span></p>

<p>The dolls sat in their chairs and looked
on, while the young hostess turned the tea
into the cups very gracefully. "Ahem,"
said she, trying to look very grown-up,
"does tea 'fect your nerves, Mrs. Rose?"</p>

<p>"Yes'm,&mdash;I don' know," replied Mrs.
Rose, puckering her lips to fit the tiny
spoon.</p>

<p>"You goin' to <i>piece</i> the meat, and give
all as much as each?"</p>

<p>"No, Mrs. Rose: you may take your
fork and put one slice of meat on each
doll's plate."</p>

<p>Rose obeyed; and then, as nothing else
was said, she asked,&mdash;</p>

<p>"How <i>is</i> your chillens, Mrs. Frizzle?"</p>

<p>"All are well that you see here at the
table, ma'am; but the rest are down with
measles," returned the little lady of the
teapot. "Will you have some of the fruit,
Mrs. Rose?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span></p>

<p>"O, that isn't <i>fyuit</i>," said the small
guest; "that's <i>blackb'ry perserves</i>; but
we'll make b'lieve it's fyuit. Yes'm: thank
you, if you please."</p>

<p>"Brackberries <i>are</i> fruits," said the correct
Mrs. Frizzle; "and currants are fruits.
You can tell 'em just as easy. When anything
has seeds to it, then it's a fruit; and,
when it <i>hasn't</i> seeds, it's a vegetable."</p>

<p>"O, I thought peaches was fyuits; and
peaches hasn't any seeds," said Rose, faintly.</p>

<p>"Why, you little ignoramus! Of course
peaches have stones! Who ever said they
had seeds!"</p>

<p>"I don't like to have you call me <i>niggeramus</i>,"
said Rose, with a quivering lip.
"My mamma never said so."</p>

<p>"Well, my sister Ninny says so; and
she studies hist'ry. You don't know
what words mean, Rosie; you don't go
to school!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span></p>

<p>"No," said Rose, hanging her head, "I
haven't never been to school, 'cause mamma
says I'm not velly well."</p>

<p>"'Fore I'd be a cry-baby, Mrs. Midge,"
returned Flaxie, enjoying the very humble
look on her cousin's face. "You wouldn't
dare go to school, 'cause there are cows in
the road."</p>

<p>"I'm 'fraid of cows when they have
their hooks on," said Rosie, still hanging
her head.</p>

<p>"I guess everybody knows that. Will
you please pass the cream-pitcher?"</p>

<p>"It's velly funny <i>queam</i>" said dear little
Rose, winking away her tears.</p>

<p>"This isn't cream, ma'am; it's condensed
milk."</p>

<p>"<i>Condemned</i> milk?"</p>

<p>"No: I said <i>condensed</i>, not condemned.
You look as if you never saw any before."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span></p>

<p>"My papa hasn't got a condensed cow,"
said Rose, humbly.</p>

<p>"You goosie, goosie," laughed Flaxie.
"My papa hasn't got a condensed cow,
either; nobody has. You <i>buy</i> this kind of
milk at the store. I'm going right into
the parlor to tell my mother what you
said."</p>

<p>"Don't, O, don't," implored little Rose.</p>

<p>Flaxie knew her young cousin dreaded
to be laughed at;&mdash;all children dread it;&mdash;but,
forgetting her manners, and the Golden
Rule, too, she sprang up from the table
and ran to the door, little Rose creeping
after her, all the happiness gone out of her
face.</p>

<p>Mrs. Prim was in the parlor, and it did
seem as if she would never be done laughing
about that "condensed cow;" but Mrs.
Gray only said,&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span></p>

<p>"Well, well; no wonder the darling
didn't know."</p>

<p>Sweet, sensitive Rose stood in the doorway,
looking down at her boots and thinking
how silly Mrs. Prim was, and how unkind
her dear cousin Flaxie.</p>

<p>"I used to love Flaxie," thought she,
squeezing back a tear; "but now I wish I
could go wight home and stay there.
Plaguing little girls like me, when I comed
to purpose to please her!"</p>

<p>"What are you crying about, you precious?"
asked Dodo, as the child wandered
into the kitchen.</p>

<p>Gentle little Rose didn't like to tell.</p>

<p>"O, I know," said Dodo. "Flaxie has got
into one of her teasing spells; and, when
she does, there's no peace for anybody."</p>

<p>Mrs. Gray did not talk in that way to
Rose.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span></p>

<p>"Flaxie loves you dearly, if she <i>is</i> rude.
Don't mind all the little things she says
to you, darling. Try to be brave and
laugh it off."</p>

<p>"I would laugh, auntie, only it makes
my head ache to shake it the leastest
speck."</p>

<p>"Flaxie," said Mrs. Gray, taking her
little daughter one side, "is this the way
you are going to treat your dear cousin?
I cannot permit it."</p>

<p>"Well, I won't," replied Flaxie, quite
ashamed of herself; "but she cries so easy,
mamma, as easy as a&mdash;a&mdash;beetle bug."</p>

<p>Next morning Rosa's head ached harder
than ever, and Flaxie laughed and danced
all the time. Rosie did wish she wouldn't
be so noisy.</p>

<p>"How sober you are, Midge Abbott.
Don't you want me to tell you a story?"</p>

<p>"Yes. Do, O, do."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span></p>

<p>What spirit of mischief seized Flaxie,
just then, to want to frighten Rose? She
loved her dearly; but she enjoyed making
her tremble, she could do it so easily.</p>

<p>"Well, there <i>was</i> an old <i>woo-ooman</i>, all
<i>skin</i> and <i>bo-one</i>," began Flaxie, in a singsong
tone.</p>

<p>It was a dreadful, dreadful story, which
she had heard Tommy Winters, a naughty
boy, tell, and her mamma had forbidden
her ever to repeat it; but she forgot that.
She only wanted to see if Rose would
scream as loud as she herself had screamed
on hearing it.</p>

<p>Scream? Poor Rosie fairly shrieked.</p>

<p>"Stop! O, do stop," said Flaxie.</p>

<p>But Rose could not stop.</p>

<p>"There isn't any such woman," said
Flaxie.</p>

<p>But Rose cried all the same.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span></p>

<p>"There never <i>was</i> such a woman! Now
won't you stop?"</p>

<p>"O, dear, dear, dear!" sobbed Rose.</p>

<p>"There never <i>will</i> be such a woman,
you darling. There, <i>now</i> won't you stop?
I've told you so over and over, but still
you keep crying," said Flaxie, in real dismay.</p>

<p>"What's the matter now?" asked Ninny,
coming into the nursery, and finding Rose
curled up in a little heap of misery in the
corner.</p>

<p>"I don't know what to do with her. I
s'pose it's me that's to blame," said Flaxie,
rather sulkily, though she was very sorry
too. "I can't say a single thing but she
cries."</p>

<p>"Well, you must be kind to her; she
isn't used to cross words. Her sister Lucy
is very different from you," said Ninny,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
taking Rose into her arms, in a motherly
way.</p>

<p>"You blame me, and everybody blames
me," growled Flaxie; "but I can't say an
<i>eeny-teeny</i> thing but she cries."</p>

<p>Flaxie kept telling herself Rose was a
cry-baby; but in her heart she knew it
was her own rudeness which had wounded
her sensitive little cousin in the first place.
She knew Rose was the sort of little girl
who never could "get over" any thing in a
minute, and so ought not to be teased.</p>

<p>"I'll make it up," thought Flaxie.
"Maybe I <i>have</i> been naughty; but I'll
make it up."</p>

<p>So, about supper-time, she came along to
Rose, and very sweetly offered to cut some
paper dolls for her.</p>

<p>"Now 'twill be all right," thought Flaxie;
but by that time even paper dolls had lost<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
their charm for Rose. There was a settled
pain in the little girl's forehead, and her
cheeks kept flushing and flushing till they
were a deep crimson.</p>

<p>"Come, sit in auntie's lap," said Mrs.
Gray, putting down the baby, and a little
startled by Rosie's quick breathing. "Come
and tell auntie if darling feels sick anywhere."</p>

<p>"I don't know," moaned little Rose; but
she seemed very glad to lay her hot face
against her aunt's shoulder; and it was not
two minutes before she was fast asleep.</p>

<p>"I don't feel quite easy about her," said
Mrs. Gray to her husband, when he came
home to supper.</p>

<p>Dr. Gray felt the child's pulse, and
said,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Perhaps she has taken a sudden cold."
He did not like to tell his wife that he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
was afraid of scarlet fever. But before
long she knew it for herself: the symptoms
were not to be mistaken.</p>

<p>It was thought at first that Flaxie and
the baby, who had neither of them had the
fever, must be sent away. But the doctor
said, "No, there would be danger of their
carrying the dreadful disease to others.</p>

<p>"It is better that they should stay at
home," said he: "only Flaxie must be
very sure never to see her sick cousin or
go into her room."</p>

<p>"Never see Rosie! Yes, that was what
Dr. Papa said," sobbed Flaxie. "O Dodo,
did he mean <i>never</i>?"</p>

<p>How could Dodo tell? How could even
poor, white-faced Aunt Jane tell, who came
at once to nurse her darling daughter.
She had to wait like all the rest.</p>

<p>Do you know how hard it is to wait?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
Do you know how long that week was
to Flaxie, with the dreary days coming
and going, and still no change for the better?</p>

<p>No: you do not know, unless you, too,
have had a friend who was very sick.</p>

<p>And the aching that was at Flaxie's
heart, the yearning she felt to throw her
arms round her little cousin's neck and
beg forgiveness!</p>

<p>Ah! you can not even guess at that
unless you, too, have been unkind to a
dear friend who may possibly be going to
die.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span></p>



<p class="ph2" style="margin-top: 1em; margin-bottom: 1em;"><a name="ChIX." id="ChIX.">IX.</a></p>

<p class="ph3">THE WEE WHITE ROSE.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">No</span> need now to caution Flaxie not to
make a noise. She crept about the house
as still as a shadow, with an old, heartbroken
look on her childish face, pitiful to
see.</p>

<p>And, far away in the east chamber, lay
dear little Rose, flushed with fever.</p>

<p>O, if you had only known what a darling
it was that lay there!</p>

<p>From her sweet babyhood she had always
been a sunbeam in her father's house; and,
after her father died, a year ago, it had
really seemed as if she thought she must
try to comfort her poor mamma.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span></p>

<p>Aunt Jane, her mamma, was very delicate;
and, when Dr. Gray came to see her
once, he said to little Rose,&mdash;</p>

<p>"You're mamma's little nurse. Don't
forget to take good care of her."</p>

<p>And Rose did not forget. After that,
she often said,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Unker Docker, I <i>do</i> take care o' mamma."</p>

<p>If Mrs. Abbott dressed to go out, the
little daughter would say,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Why, mamma, you must have your
<i>yubbers</i>. I'll go get your yubbers and
warm 'em this minute."</p>

<p><i>Lucy</i> never thought of warming the
rubbers, and she was a good girl too.</p>

<p>When Mrs. Abbott stepped into the cold
hall, Rose followed with a little white
lambswool shawl, begging her to put it
over her shoulders.</p>

<p>She did not like to give her beautiful<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
sick mother any trouble, so she dressed and
undressed herself, though scarcely five
years old; and every day, after dinner,
went to her little room, lay down on the
bed, and took her nap without being told.</p>

<p>Mrs. Abbott had been in New Jersey
only three days, when Dr. Gray telegraphed
to her that Rosie was ill, and she hurried
home as fast as she could.</p>

<p>The morning after she returned was little
Rosie's birthday, and that morning a present
had come from her dear, good "Unker
Willum,"&mdash;a lovely muff and tippet, such
as she had long been wishing to have.
Mamma brought them and laid them beside
her on the bed.</p>

<p>"Wasn't it beautiful?" mamma said.
"And see the squirrel's head on the muff,
and the cunning <i>porte-monnaie</i> inside."</p>

<p>"Yes, pretty, pretty," said little Rosie;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
for her head was thumping so hard that it
did not please her very much, after all.</p>

<p>Once she had told dear "Unker Willum"
that, if she had a lot of money, she should
be "perfickly happy."</p>

<p>"How much money would make you perfickly
happy?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Three hundred and three thousand and
thirty-six cents," said Rose; and, every
time he asked her, she gave the same answer.</p>

<p>So now there was a neat little note inside
the muff, and it told Rosie that, when
next Christmas came, "Unker Willum
would send her three hundred and three
thousand and thirty-six cents and make his
darling niece 'perfickly happy.'"</p>

<p>Rosie did not clap her hands or laugh
at this letter as "Unker Willum" had expected;
she only smiled faintly, and by-and-bye<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
began to cry softly to herself.
Mamma said,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Is it your head, darling?"</p>

<p>"Yes, mamma, my head aches; but that
isn't what makes me cry. I was s'posin'
would you and Lucy and Bertie be very
lonesome 'thout me, if I should go way off
up to heaven?"</p>

<p>"Don't talk so, my precious child," said
Mrs. Abbott. "God doesn't want you to
die; He wants you to live to be mamma's
dear little comfort."</p>

<p>"Does He?" asked Rosie, opening her
sweet, blue eyes, and fixing them on her
mother's face. Then she moved her head
from side to side on the pillow, and said,&mdash;</p>

<p>"No, mamma, I think I'm going up to
heaven velly soon."</p>

<p>Mrs. Abbott's heart throbbed with a
quick pain at these words; and she began<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
to tell Rosie some stories to take up her
mind; such as "Little Bopeep has Lost
her Sheep," and "Little Boy Blue, come,
Blow your Horn!"</p>

<p>"Mamma," said Rosie, "I'd ravver hear
that pretty story 'bout Jesus&mdash;it's so much
nicer. How he came down here, and put
his hands on the little chillens."</p>

<p>Then Mrs. Abbott sang, in a trembling
voice,&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"'I think, when I read that sweet story of old,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">When Jesus was here among men,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">How he called little children as lambs to his fold,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">I should like to have been with them then.'"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>"That's nice,&mdash;so nice," said little Rosie,
smiling. "Now I'll go to sleep, mamma."</p>

<p>Next day her little head was worse.
Flaxie had begged Aunt Jane to take her
all her pretty playthings; but the sick
child did not care for them now. There
were Flaxie's wee chairs and sofas and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
pictures to furnish her baby-house, and
dishes to set her baby-table. Rosie did not
like them now; but she knew she <i>had</i>
liked them when she was well.</p>

<p>"Mamma," said she, "shall I have playfings
up in heaven?"</p>

<p>"Yes, dear: prettier ones than these."</p>

<p>"O, I am so glad. And, mamma, must
I take my best dresses when I go up?&mdash;my
blue one with the pretty wuffles, you
know, and my little pink <i>beauty</i> dress?"</p>

<p>"No, darling: God will give you nicer
clothes than those to wear."</p>

<p>"Will he, mamma? O, that's very nice."</p>

<p>She lay quite still for a long time, and
then called her mother to her bedside.</p>

<p>"Mamma, you 'member that sweet story
you sung to me 'bout Jesus?"</p>

<p>"Yes, dear."</p>

<p>"And is it all truly true, mamma?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes: quite true, my child."</p>

<p>"Well, that's all I want to know,
mamma," said the blessed baby; and then,
with a happy smile, she pressed her cheek
against the pillow, and dropped off to
sleep.</p>

<p>They were glad of that, for they thought
the rest would do her good; but, ah! she
slept so long, so very long! A week went
by, and still she had not waked. Then
she opened her eyes, and faintly said,
"Mamma, mamma."</p>

<p>Mamma bent over her, very happy to
hear her sweet voice once more; and the
child placed one of her little arms about
her dear mother's neck, and so fell asleep
again.</p>

<p>Dr. and Mrs. Gray watched beside her
with sad mamma; for they knew now that
little Rose was going away from them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span></p>

<p>She woke at last; and, O, how happy
she was! for she found herself in a beautiful
world,&mdash;more beautiful than any
thing she had ever dreamed of,&mdash;and Some
One was holding her in His arms. She
was sure it was the dear Jesus; and she
nestled close to His breast, too happy to
speak. Her mother could not see this;
but she <i>knew</i> the Lord had taken little
Rosie; and, though her heart was very
sad, she looked up through her tears, and
said,&mdash;</p>

<p>"It is well with the child."</p>

<p>But poor Flaxie! When they told her
that little Rosie had gone away to play
with the angels, she sobbed, bitterly,&mdash;</p>

<p>"O mamma, mamma, if I hadn't teased
her, <i>if</i> I only hadn't! And now God has
taken her away; and I can't tell her I'm
sorry!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span></p>

<p>Ah, it was a sad, sad lesson to little
Flaxie.</p>

<p>"I prayed as hard as I could, ever so
long," wailed she. "God could have made
her well if He had thought best; and then
what a hugging I was going to give her!
I wasn't <i>ever</i> going to plague her again!"</p>

<p>Weeks after this, Mrs. Gray saw Flaxie
one day standing at the front door, with
her hands clasped, looking straight upward
into the sky.</p>

<p>"Dear God," she murmured, softly,
"won't you please let me peek in a minute
and see Rosie? If you can't let me
peek in, won't you please tell Rosie I'm
sorry?"</p>

<p class="ph3">PRESTON'S GOLD DOLLAR.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">My</span> eyes are so full of tears, as I think
of dear little Rose that I am going to talk
now about something very different. I
think I shall tell you of one of Preston's
mishaps.</p>

<p>I am afraid when you read it you will
say to yourself, "Well, <i>he</i> isn't much of a
boy!" But please remember, he was hardly
ten years old when the affair happened;
and boys are not as wise as Solomon until
they are <i>at least</i> twelve or thirteen.</p>

<p>Preston was doing Aunt Jane's errands
for her that week; he did them one week
and Bert the next.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span></p>

<p>"I wonder why Preston doesn't come,"
said Aunt Jane, stirring some medicine with
a spoon, and speaking to Grandpa Pressy,
who had come visiting again, and was sitting
in the corner reading a newspaper.</p>

<p>Grandpa Pressy looked up with a pleasant
smile, while the paper danced as
if it would fly out of his hands; for he had
palsy.</p>

<p>"Hark, Jane, there's his whistle, and he
isn't generally far behind it."</p>

<p>In another moment the door opened, and
in walked Preston, a bright, handsome boy,
who did not look much like Flaxie, for he
had dark eyes and black hair.</p>

<p>"Why, Preston," said Aunt Jane, patting
his small face, "you'll be late to
school. Here it is nine o'clock."</p>

<p>"Don't care if it's forty-nine. No school
to-day."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span></p>

<p>"No school? O, it's Saturday; I forgot
about that, and saved a turnover for you
to take to school."</p>

<p>"Well, I'd like it all the same," said
Preston, looking laughingly toward the
cellar door. "Had breakfast a good while
ago."</p>

<p>Aunt Jane smiled, which was a rare
thing for her. She had been very sad
since Rose died.</p>

<p>"Very well, dear. Run to the store;
and, when you come back, you shall have
the turnover and a piece of sage cheese
with it. I don't know what I should do
without you, now Bertie's gone to New
Jersey."</p>

<p>"A dear good boy he is," thought Aunt
Jane, as the little fellow disappeared with
the gallon jug; and Grandpa Pressy, as if
he had heard her thought, answered,&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes, Preston is a dear good boy, Jane.
His mother worries for fear he'll fall into
bad company; but it's my opinion she is
over-anxious. Preston will come out all
right."</p>

<p>"O, yes, we all think so," responded
Aunt Jane. "And who ever heard of such
a child to do errands? He and Ninny are
alike about that; they are both a great
deal better than Lucy. Really, I've a great
mind to make the boy a little present;
now wouldn't you, grandpa? You know he
does all these things for nothing."</p>

<p>"O, you wait. I've got just what he'll
like," said Grandpa Pressy, putting his
shaking hand into his pocket, and jerking
out his leathern wallet,&mdash;"just what he'll
like, Jane."</p>

<p>After a long and trembling search, during
which the pieces of paper money rattled<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
like dry leaves, out flew a little gold
dollar, and danced upon the floor.</p>

<p>"How that will please him!" said Aunt
Jane. "I don't believe he ever saw one."</p>

<p>"Yes, I think it will please him, my
dear. He's uncommonly good to his poor
old grandpa; and I'm sure I don't grudge
him a pretty little keepsake like this."</p>

<p>So, when Preston returned with the
molasses, and had eaten his turnover and
sage cheese, his eyes were feasted with a
sight of the bit of gold.</p>

<p>"Why, grandpa, <i>all</i> this for me?"</p>

<p>"Yes, my boy; and your mother'd better
lay it away somewhere, and keep it
till you are older."</p>

<p>"Yes, I'll ask her to; for Flaxie or Phil
will be sure to get hold of it. But now
I'm a-going to tie it up in the corner of
my handkerchief, and put it in my pocket."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span></p>

<p>"That's a good way," said Aunt Jane.</p>

<p>"Good-bye, auntie, good-bye, grandpa.
When you want any more molasses and
things, I'm the boy to get 'em."</p>

<p>And off started Preston in gay spirits,
sending a long, shrill whistle before him,
and running to catch up with it. His first
thought was to go home, and give the
gold piece to his mother for safe keeping;
but he lived half a mile down town, and
it did seem too bad to spare the time from
play.</p>

<p>"Hullo, Pres," called out a ringing
voice, "what you smiling at down there?"</p>

<p>Preston stopped whistling, and looked
up to see where the voice came from.</p>

<p>Tommy Winters was sitting on the
bough of a horsechestnut-tree, eating gingerbread.
Now Tommy was a naughty,
reckless fellow, and Preston had been forbidden<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
to play with him; but the sight
of Tommy's face filled him with a vague
longing, not for gingerbread, but for mischief.</p>

<p>There really was a bad charm about
Tommy&mdash;when he fixed his "glittering
eye" upon you, he made you think of all
sorts of delightful things you'd like to do,
only they were apt to be naughty things.
Did you ever see a boy who had a bad
charm?</p>

<p>"What you up to down there?" repeated
Tommy, as Preston finished tying up the
gold piece, and put it in his pocket.</p>

<p>"O, I'm up to lots o' things," replied
Preston, gaily. "Don't you wish you knew
what I've got in my handkerchief?"</p>

<p>Tommy didn't know of course; but he
instantly <i>guessed</i> there was money in the
handkerchief: he could see the hard knot,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
and he could see the smile on Preston's
face; and Tommy was not a fool by any
means.</p>

<p>"If that's money, I guess I can coax it
out of him some way or other. Anyhow,
I mean to get it, by hook or by crook,"
thought the bad boy.</p>

<p>But he pretended he didn't care two
straws what was in the handkerchief.
"Come," said he, "put your old rags in
your pocket, and let's go swimming."</p>

<p>Now Preston had always longed to swim,
chiefly, I suppose, because he didn't know
how. It was a remarkably warm day in
October; but the water was very cold: it
was not proper for anybody to go into it;
and both the boys knew this.</p>

<p>Preston looked up at Tommy; and that
bad charm began to work. He saw a picture
in his mind's eye of&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span></p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"A quiet nook in the running brook,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Where the school-boys went to swim."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>So, instead of running away, as he ought
to have done, he kept staring up in the
tree at Tommy, and said,&mdash;</p>

<p>"I can't go swimming; mother won't let
me. But I should think you might come
down here and give us a piece of your
gingerbread."</p>

<p>Tommy dropped nimbly from the tree,
and alighted on his head.</p>

<p>"What's that you say about your
mother!"</p>

<p>"She won't let me go swimming."</p>

<p>"Won't let you?&mdash;of course not. Never
heard of a woman that would. Women
are always scared of the water."</p>

<p>"Father won't let me either."</p>

<p>"You don't say so. Here, take a bite
of gingerbread."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span></p>

<p>Preston took a bite; but he saw Tommy
was in earnest about swimming, and he
caught himself by the left ear, as if that
would keep him from going with him: yet,
somehow, he felt as if he <i>should</i> go, in
spite of his fears.</p>

<p>"Look here, Tommy."</p>

<p>"Well, I'm looking."</p>

<p>"Now, Tommy Winters."</p>

<p>"Yes, that's my name."</p>

<p>"You know that brook&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yes, guess so. Prime place down there
under the willer-tree."</p>

<p>"But, Tommy, that was where my sister
Flaxie got 'most drowned."</p>

<p>"'Twas high water then; it's low water
now. 'Twouldn't drown a grass'per."</p>

<p>"But, Tommy,&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Well, Pres, what you 'fraid of?"</p>

<p>"Ain't afraid of any thing; but my
mother says&mdash;"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span></p>

<p>"O, 'fraid o' your ma'am!"</p>

<p>"And my father says&mdash;"</p>

<p>"O, 'fraid o' your pa!"</p>

<p>"Well, they both say&mdash;"</p>

<p>"O, 'fraid o' both of 'em!"</p>

<p>"No; but you see, Tommy, they think&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I know what they think; they think
you're a good-for-nothing girl-baby;" and
Tommy made up such a face that Preston
couldn't help laughing. It didn't hurt his
feelings to have <i>Tommy</i> call him names;
for he did it in the funniest, pleasantest
way. O, Tommy <i>was</i> a very fascinating
boy!</p>

<p>"Come along, you little tip-end of a
top-o-my-thumb."</p>

<p>"Tell you <i>no</i>, Tommy."</p>

<p>Preston was pretty firm now.</p>

<p>"Give you Turkish bath, all for nothing,
Pres."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span></p>

<p>"But I told you, Tommy&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No, you didn't; you haven't told me a
thing. You stutter so I can't understand
a word."</p>

<p>At the idea of his stuttering, Preston
laughed outright; and, during that moment
of weakness, was picked up and set astride
Tommy's shoulders.</p>

<p>"You set me down," cried Preston,
struggling manfully, yet a little glad, perhaps,
to think he couldn't possibly help
himself.</p>

<p>"Ride away, ride away, <i>Preston</i> shall
ride!" sang Tommy, the large, strong fellow,
bouncing his burden up and down.</p>

<p>Preston felt like a dry leaf in a whirlpool.
You know how it swings round and
round; and, every time it swings, it gets
nearer and nearer that hungry hole in the
middle, where there is no getting out again.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span></p>

<p>"I can't help it, I <i>can't</i> help it," thought
little Preston, as big Tommy jolted him up
and down like a bag of meal on horseback.</p>

<p>Well, it is good fun for little boys to go
in swimming, I do suppose,&mdash;if their
parents are willing, if they have somebody
to hold them up, and if the water isn't too
cold.</p>

<p>At first, Preston almost thought he was
having good fun; but very soon it was any
thing but that;&mdash;why, it was just frightful!
for Tommy had actually gone off and
left him, and snapped his fingers in his
face. Preston couldn't swim any more than
a fish-hook. What would become of him?
Where <i>was</i> Tommy?</p>

<p>Tommy was on the bank, pretending to
skip stones; but that was not what he had
gone there for, I assure you. He had gone
to look in Preston's pocket, and see what<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
was tied up in the corner of his handkerchief.</p>

<p>"Why don't you come, Tommy? Tom-<i>mee</i>!
I'm drow&mdash;drow&mdash;drowning!"</p>

<p>"O, you hush up! I'll come in a minute."</p>

<p>"Come now&mdash;ow&mdash;ow! Flaxie got
drow&mdash;ow&mdash;owned!"</p>

<p>Tommy came when he got ready. And,
as he swam back to Preston, there was
something under his tongue, which was a
very sweet morsel to him, and about the
size of a gold dollar.</p>

<p>"You <i>said</i> 'twouldn't drown a grasshopper;
but 'twould drown a man&mdash;with
his hat on," gurgled little Preston, indignantly.</p>

<p>Tommy tickled him under the arms, but
didn't seem to feel much like talking.</p>

<p>"There," said he, when they had come<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
out of the water, "now I'm going to dress
you and send you home to your mother."</p>

<p>"Dress <i>me</i>? Poh, guess I can dress myself!"</p>

<p>"Well, you better hurry then," said
Tommy. "What makes you so slow?
Your mother'll go into spasms."</p>

<p>"My mother? Why, she don't know I've
been swimming!"</p>

<p>"O, I forgot; well, run home!"</p>

<p>"Don't want to," said Preston, squeezing
his hair; "want to play ball. Come
on!"</p>

<p>"Can't," said Tom; "have to get some
coal."</p>

<p>"Do they make you work Saturdays?"</p>

<p>"Yes, all day, like a dog," muttered
Tom, taking to his heels.</p>

<p>Everybody knew that Tom never worked,
so this was absurd. Preston ran after him,
and caught him by the sleeve.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span></p>

<p>"Come, let's play ball!"</p>

<p>Tom shook him off as if he had been a
cobweb.</p>

<p>"Can't play to-day. Got an awful sore
throat, and earache and toothache."</p>

<p>And away he ran. Preston was left
staring after him, and wondering why he
hadn't spoken of his sufferings before.</p>

<p>"He's queer, Tommy is. Don't see what
he wanted to go swimming for if he's sick.
Thought I should 'a' froze!"</p>

<p>A guilty feeling was upon Preston, which
made him shiver more than the cold.</p>

<p>"Wish my hair wasn't so thick. Can't
go home till it dries."</p>

<p>He played about with some boys for an
hour or two, then went home. The family
were all seated at dinner, and Flaxie would
not eat till he came.</p>

<p>"I've got something you'll want to see,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
Flaxie. Come out here and show yourself,
sir." This to his handkerchief, which
he whipped out of his pocket.</p>

<p>"What is it? I don't see any thing,"
said Flaxie.</p>

<p>"Why, where in the world? Why,
what's this?" cried Preston, in dismay.</p>

<p>There was nothing in the end of the
handkerchief, and the knot was untied.</p>

<p>"I tied it up in three knots, I know I
did; and now where is it?"</p>

<p>"Where is what?" asked his mother.</p>

<p>"Why, my little gold dollar. Grandpa
gave it to me this morning. You never
<i>saw</i> any thing so cunning!"</p>

<p>"Are you sure you tied it hard?"</p>

<p>"Why, yes, indeed! I tied it so hard I
had to hop up and down to get my breath!
Three knots too!"</p>

<p>Dr. Gray looked up, and asked,&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span></p>

<p>"You haven't been with any bad boys,
my son?"</p>

<p>Preston had forgotten the swimming, for
the moment, and said,&mdash;</p>

<p>"O, no, sir; Eddie Potter and Jack
Snow and those."</p>

<p>"They say Tommy Winters will steal;
but of course you haven't been near <i>him</i>?"</p>

<p>Preston dropped his knife and fork suddenly,
and blushed. His mother saw it;
but his father did not, for he was hurrying
out of the house to visit a patient.</p>

<p>All that afternoon poor Preston was in
trouble. He told the boys about it, but
nobody could help him; and, as for Tommy
Winters, he was nowhere to be seen.</p>

<p>Finally, after tea, he stole up to his best
friend, his mother, and exclaimed, shaking
his fist,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Tommy Winters has got my gold dollar,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
mamma. Tell you what, he stole it
out of my pocket when I was swimming."</p>

<p>"Swimming, Preston?"</p>

<p>"Yes'm: you see he made me go."</p>

<p>"<i>Made</i> you, my son?"</p>

<p>Preston hung his head.</p>

<p>"Well, he marched me down to the
brook, he did."</p>

<p>"He didn't throw you in?"</p>

<p>"Not ed-zackly."</p>

<p>"Then you went in yourself?"</p>

<p>"Yes, mamma; but, O, I won't do so
again."</p>

<p>Mrs. Gray looked very sober. She was
not thinking of the gold dollar, but of her
son's disobedience.</p>

<p>"I'm sure he stole it, mamma; and now
he has run off, and nobody can find him."</p>

<p>"Very likely," said Mrs. Gray.</p>

<p>"O mamma, won't you make him give
back my gold dollar?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span></p>

<p>"Do you deserve it, my son?"</p>

<p>"Well, but grandpa gave it to me."</p>

<p>"I'll talk with your father about it."</p>

<p>"O, don't talk with father: he'll think
just what <i>you</i> think," cried Preston, in
alarm.</p>

<p>His mother did not answer; and he ran
out to the stable, threw himself into a bed
of hay, and tried his best to hate her.</p>

<p>"She'll tell him I disobeyed, and he'll
say, 'Good enough for him, then!'"</p>

<p>Dr. Gray did say exactly these words;
still, he tried to make Tommy confess and
give up the stolen gold. Do you suppose
Tommy confessed?</p>

<p>O, no: he looked the doctor right in the
eye, and said,&mdash;</p>

<p>"What <i>is</i> a gold dollar? I never heard
of such a thing in my life!"</p>

<p>Preston never set eyes on his treasure<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
again; but I suppose it has done him more
good, after all, than a hundred gold dollars
at compound interest for a hundred years.</p>

<p>You know why. It made him remember
to keep out of bad company.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span></p>




<p class="ph2" style="margin-top: 1em; margin-bottom: 1em;"><a name="ChXI." id="ChXI.">XI.</a></p>

<p class="ph3">PRESTON KEEPING HOUSE.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Now</span> I should not have told this bad
story about Preston if I had not had a
better one to tell after it, "to take the taste
out," as Flaxie said about the orange.</p>

<p>Grandpa Pressy went home a little while
after this, and took Ninny with him, because
he was not very well, and wanted
her to amuse him; but nobody felt alarmed
about him, till, one day at noon, a message
came for Dr. and Mrs. Gray, that he
was very ill.</p>

<p>As it happened, Dora Whalen had gone
away that morning in the cars to spend<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
the day in Jersey City; and there was no
one to take charge of the house.</p>

<p>"Just as if <i>I</i> couldn't do it," said Preston.</p>

<p>"Now, my son, do you really think you
can be trusted?" said Mrs. Gray. "Will
you watch Flaxie carefully, and keep her
out of mischief? I don't want to take her
to Aunt Jane's; for, if I take the baby
there, that will be quite enough."</p>

<p>"Poh, yes'm: guess I'm ten years old!"</p>

<p>"Dora won't be back till the last train.
Are you sure you won't be afraid to be
left all alone in the house after dark, you
two little folks?"</p>

<p>"Yes'm, certain sure. What are you
smiling for, mother? To think you've got
a boy that's smart enough to keep house?"</p>

<p>"Well, yes, it does make me happy to
see my son so ready to please his father
and mother."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span></p>

<p>Then she hesitated a moment, turned to
her husband, and said,&mdash;</p>

<p>"If we only knew just <i>how</i> sick grandpa
is, perhaps we could wait till to-morrow."</p>

<p>"They would not have telegraphed if
they had not needed us," said Dr. Gray,
decidedly.</p>

<p>"Yes, yes, I suppose you are right," said
Mrs. Gray, looking thoughtful, as she put
on her bonnet before the glass. "There,
baby and I are ready. Have you charged
Preston about locking up the house?"</p>

<p>"Yes; and Preston, my son, you must
spend the evening in the kitchen: it won't
do to have a fire in the sitting-room till
Dora comes. And don't put a stick of
wood in the stove after seven o'clock. Can
you remember?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir."</p>

<p>"You'd better both go to bed by eight,"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
said Mrs. Gray. "Dora has a night-key, and
can let herself in."</p>

<p>"O mother, mayn't I sit up till nine?
I want to copy off my <i>compersition</i>."</p>

<p>"Well, yes, if Flaxie is willing, and it
isn't too cold in the kitchen. But don't
forget to tuck her into her little crib by
eight. I've moved it close to my bed,
where you are to sleep."</p>

<p>"And is Preston goin' to sleep in the
downstairs room? O, goody!" cried Flaxie,
crushing her mother's bonnet with a parting
hug.</p>

<p>"Yes, darling; and you'll find your supper
of baked apples and milk on the table,
covered with a napkin, and something nice
beside, I won't say what."</p>

<p>"I know&mdash;<i>squinch-perserve</i>," said Flaxie.</p>

<p>"Good-bye till to-morrow, my precious
children. Don't give Dodo any trouble;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
and, Preston, don't forget what father said
about the fires."</p>

<p>It wasn't likely Preston would forget.
He was one of those slow-brained, faithful
little fellows, who can't learn a spelling-lesson,
but who are pretty much at home
with every thing except books.</p>

<p>"He was always so different from Flaxie.
We shall never be able to leave Flaxie in
charge of any thing; you might as well set
a squirrel to watch a weasel," said Dr.
Gray.</p>

<p>"I know it," replied his wife; "but I
never saw a child six years old that <i>could</i>
take charge of any thing, did you?"</p>

<p>Flaxie began to call for her supper the
moment her father and mother and little
Phil were out of sight.</p>

<p>"'Cause there's queam-cakes, too, I saw
'em. And then I guess I'd better go see
Lucy; she's spectin' me."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span></p>

<p>"No, <i>ma'am</i>, Flaxie Frizzle," said Preston,
firmly. "You're not going further than
the weeping-willow this day; and I shan't
let you do that if you don't behave."</p>

<p>The new tone of command rather awed
little Miss Frizzle; and, to Preston's surprise,
she began to cry.</p>

<p>"I want to go to heaven," said she, throwing
the kitten angrily across the room.
"I've got tired o' waitin' to go to heaven."</p>

<p>Preston could not help laughing; for
Flaxie looked very, very little like an angel.</p>

<p>"God won't let me peek in, and he
won't take me up there," went on the child,
sulkily. "You needn't laugh, Preston;
you don't know what I want to do. I've
got sumpin' for Rosa, and I want to carry
it to her."</p>

<p>"Why, Rosa is dead."</p>

<p>"No; she's in heaven. Here's sumpin' I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
want her to have," said Flaxie, opening a
little box, and displaying a China lamb. "I
<i>'tended</i> it for her, and I'm <i>'termined</i> she
shall have it."</p>

<p>Flaxie was crying still, but her anger was
gone; she was crying for dear little Rosa.</p>

<p>"Won't you let me go and carry the
lamb to Rosa?"</p>

<p>"Why, where do you want to go?"</p>

<p>"O, I want to go and put it side o' the
flowers," replied Flaxie.</p>

<p>"Well, I'll go with you; only you act
very queer, Flaxie."</p>

<p>He gave his little sister his hand; and she
led him along Elm Street and up the hill
to the cemetery.</p>

<p>"O, is that what you mean?" said he.</p>

<p>"Yes," replied Flaxie, kneeling and
placing the white lamb on Rosa's grave,
along with the myrtles and evergreens that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
had just been planted there. "That's for
<i>you</i>, Rosa! I 'tended it for you, when
you's sick, and I'm 'termined you shall
have it."</p>

<p>"How will she get it up in heaven?"
asked Preston, in a whisper.</p>

<p>"I don' know. God will see 'bout it.
Isn't it a <i>beau</i>-ful little lamb?"</p>

<p>"O, yes."</p>

<p>"Well, I was cross to Rosa; and now
I've made it all up," said Flaxie, skipping
out of the burying-ground with a very
light heart, while her brother followed her
in silence.</p>

<p>Next minute she was laughing.</p>

<p>"O, I want to see your new steam-<i>nengine</i>,
Preston! May I, if I won't do any
thing naughty?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"And will you gi' me lots o' <i>cardinnum</i>
seeds?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Then I'll be <i>just</i> as good," said Miss
Flaxie.</p>

<p>At precisely seven o'clock, Preston put a
large stick of wood in the kitchen stove;
and, as little sister had been very obedient,
he lighted the alcohol lamp in his steam-engine,
and set the pretty machine puffing
across the floor like a thing alive. Miss
Frizzle, having eaten two suppers, was in
a very quiet mood, and threw herself on
her knees beside Preston, with her chin
upon his shoulder, to watch the wonderful
plaything.</p>

<p>"I'll tell you what it is, Flaxie," said
Preston, with an air of wisdom that was
not lost upon his listener; "I know how
this engine is put together as well as father
does; and I'll bet you I could make one,
if I only had the tools, and knew how to
use em!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span></p>

<p>"S'pose you could, honest?"</p>

<p>"Yes, to be sure. There, Flaxie, the
clock is striking eight. Now you'll have
to go to bed."</p>

<p>Flaxie's forehead began to pucker, and
her elbows to jerk.</p>

<p>"Then you must go, too, Pres Gray."</p>

<p>"O, but I want to fix up my compersition,
so I can play Saturday. Come, now,
if you'll go to bed first, I'll give you all
my fire-crackers."</p>

<p>Miss Frizzle's brows smoothed.</p>

<p>"And the pin-wheels too? Fire-crackers
isn't much."</p>

<p>"Ye-es; and the pin-wheels too. I'll fire
'em for you. Only you'll have to go to
bed as quick as scat, or I'll take it all
back."</p>

<p>Flaxie went; but, as for lying still, that
wasn't in the bargain. "Water! water!"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
called she, when snugly tucked in. "Please
bring me some water, Preston, or I shall
dry to death."</p>

<p>Preston had seated himself at his work,
and copied off in staring letters about three
lines:&mdash;</p>

<p>
"APPLES."<br />
</p>

<p>"Apples is the most frout always yoused.
Apples is said to grow in almost any
country."</p>

<p>His arm ached already.</p>

<p>"There," said he, carrying Flaxie a mug
of water. "And you just lie still, little
sister. If you speak again, it will cost you
a pin-wheel."</p>

<p>Then he went on, with great labor.</p>

<p>"In some climates it is so warm it is
said they have been discovered by the crab-apples;
they was some men got the seed
from the crab-apple, and planted it."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span></p>

<p>"Pres-tun!" cried Flaxie again. "You
may take <i>one</i> pin-wheel. I've got to speak,
'cause it <i>unsleeps</i> me not to have you come
to bed. Just <i>one</i> pin-wheel. So, there!"</p>

<p>"Yes, yes," said Preston; "I'll be there
in just sixteen minutes, if you don't speak
again."</p>

<p>"Some takes the apples, and makes cider
of them. Old cider is yoused for vinegar.</p>

<p>
"<span class="smcap">Preston S. Gray.</span>"<br />
</p>

<p>This ended the "compersition;" but, in
Preston's haste to keep his word and get
to bed in just sixteen minutes, he made a
mistake, and wrote on the back of it, "Potatoes."</p>

<p>He smiled to see Flaxie sound asleep
already, then knelt down, and prayed,
"Now I lay me," with a very solemn feeling.
The house seemed strangely quiet.
Where could Dodo be? Preston had heard
the last train rush by a half-hour before.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span></p>

<p>"I think God <i>will</i> be sure to take care
of me to-night, so I can take care of
Flaxie," thought he, creeping into bed.
"He must know father and mother have
gone off, and Flaxie isn't much more'n a
baby." And, with that, he fell asleep,
holding little sister by the hand.</p>

<p>About midnight, he was wakened by
the smell of smoke. If he had not been
downstairs, and if he had not felt, even in
sleep, the care of the house, I dare say he
would not have waked. "What's this?
Why, what is it?" thought he, raising
himself on his elbow, and sniffing.</p>

<p>The bedroom opened out of the sitting-room,
and the kitchen was just beyond.
That was where the smoke must come from;
for it was the only room that had a fire
in it.</p>

<p>Preston rose softly, and went into the
kitchen. It was on fire!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span></p>

<p>Probably some coals had fallen out of
the stove door when the last stick was put
in, and had been smouldering on the floor
ever since. Now the floor, the sink, the
drop-table, and the sitting-room door were
in flames.</p>

<p>What should be done?</p>

<p>Preston reflected. He could not write a
very deep "compersition;" but he was just
the boy to have his wits about him when
they were needed.</p>

<p>"The first thing is to get Flaxie out of
the house," thought he. "The flames are
spreading to the bedroom."</p>

<p>In a twinkling he had her in his arms,
rolled her in a shawl, and set her on the
front door-stone.</p>

<p>"Don't cry, Ducky Dilver," said he,
locking her out. "I'll come after you if
you'll be good."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span></p>

<p>Then, leaving the sleepy child sobbing
in utter bewilderment, Preston rushed back,
and dipped water from the barrel to put
out the flames.</p>

<p>It was a hard fight for a small boy. He
could not help wondering at himself to
feel how strong he was. Pailful after pailful
he dashed on; and, when the barrel
gave out, he turned to the pump in the
sink. Ah, but the sink door was ablaze!
As fast as the fire was quenched in one
place, it broke out in another; but Preston
mastered it after awhile.</p>

<p>"O, if it hadn't been for my nose,"
thought the brave little boy, wading across
the floor; "if it <i>hadn't</i> been for my nose!
Wonder if the fire has struck through to
the cellar?"</p>

<p>It had not; but there seemed to be a
smoky smell down there; and our hero
went down boldly, and dashed water upon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
the ceiling, never minding that it ran back
and wet him all over.</p>

<p>Quite satisfied at last that all was right,
he went to the front door, and let in tearful
little Flaxie.</p>

<p>"What'd you put me out for? Say,
what'd you put me out for?"</p>

<p>"So I could put out the fire, you little,
good-for-nothing baby," replied Preston,
kissing her tenderly. "What if you'd
burnt up, and I'd burnt up, too, Flaxie?
I guess 'twould have been the last time
mother'd have left <i>us</i> to keep house!"</p>

<p>And, when Dodo got home next morning,
she found them fast asleep with the sun
full in their eyes. "To think I should
have missed the train last night for the
first time in all my life," sobbed the faithful
creature, on hearing the story. "If any
harm had come to you children, I never
could have forgiven myself."</p>

<p class="ph2" style="margin-top: 1em; margin-bottom: 1em;"><a name="ChXII." id="ChXII.">XII.</a></p>

<p class="ph3">MRS. PRIM'S STRAWBERRIES.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> next summer after this, when Flaxie
was "going on seven years old," she and
sister Ninny and Lucy Abbott made a
bargain with Mrs. Prim to pick strawberries
for her at three cents a box. They
were glad to do it, for they were saving
money to buy a pretty white vase for
Rosa's grave; and they wanted to earn it
all themselves. Flaxie thought she helped
as much as anybody; but, the truth was,
she spent half the time talking and picking
the dirt out of her shoes.</p>

<p>Now, though Mrs. Prim lived in a beautiful<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
large house, and had the finest grounds
in town, the children did not like her very
well: they considered her cross.</p>

<p>And, just here I must tell you what a
time they had with her one day about the
strawberries. It was a very warm morning;
and they were all three stooping over
the vines in the garden, with a great yellow
basket before them.</p>

<p>"What a blazing hot sun," groaned
Lucy, from the depths of her speckled
shaker.</p>

<p>"O, dear, yes," responded Ninny; "and
only three cents a box for picking!"</p>

<p>"I feel the sun on the end o' my nose,"
said Flaxie.</p>

<p>Just then a man went by, chanting
musically,&mdash;</p>

<p>"'The Lord is my Shepherd; I shall not
want. He maketh me to lie down in green<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
pastures: He leadeth me beside the still
waters.'"</p>

<p>"How nice and cool that sounds," said
Ninny, wiping her forehead.</p>

<p>"<i>Who</i> lied down in the pasture, Ninny?"</p>

<p>"David."</p>

<p>"Was David a cow?"</p>

<p>"O, what a silly child," cried Lucy.</p>

<p>"I wasn't talking to <i>you</i>, I was talking
to Ninny," said Flaxie.</p>

<p>"Well, Flaxie, but you made fun of the
Holy Bible!" exclaimed Lucy, shaking her
head.</p>

<p>"I didn't either!"</p>

<p>"I don't believe you know what 'holy'
means," persisted Lucy.</p>

<p>"Yes, I do; it means the whole of it.
They call it the wholly Bible, because it's
the <i>whole</i> of the Bible."</p>

<p>"Did you ever, ever see such a goosie?"
laughed Lucy, provokingly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span></p>

<p>"Now hush, children; it's too hot for
you to be scolding," said Ninny.</p>

<p>"Yes: O, dear, it's the hottest day I ever
saw. I should think the sun would melt
and drop right down out of the sky," said
Lucy. "And there's Mrs. Prim, <i>she</i> don't
care: she's in her nice, cool parlor, with
the blinds all shut."</p>

<p>"Eating i-scream, I s'pose," put in
Flaxie.</p>

<p>"Yes," said Lucy; "and gets fifty cents
a box for these strawberries, and wouldn't
give us more'n three cents if we should
faint to pieces out here and be picked up
dead."</p>

<p>"What awful scolds you children are,"
said Ninny, who kept up her spirits by
laughing at them.</p>

<p>"Well, she did have some i-scream last
night," said little Flaxie; "for I saw her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
through the door. Why didn't she say,
'Come in, dear, and <i>you</i> may have some?'
<i>My</i> mamma would. My mamma's a great
deal better'n Mrs. Prim."</p>

<p>"O, well, lots of folks are better than
Mrs. Prim," said Ninny, growing earnest.
"Now, there's Mrs. Stillman; if she didn't
live so far off we could pick for <i>her</i>. Why
once she gave Eva Snow all she got on
three boxes, and told her to keep it, for it
was hard work to pick in such a broiling
sun. Eva took the money, and bought her
mother a great piece of salmon."</p>

<p>"O, my," cried Lucy; "why don't we
take some of the money Mr. Potter pays
us, and not give it to Mrs. Prim? I'd like
to buy <i>my</i> mamma a great big piece of&mdash;something."</p>

<p>Thus spoke the rattle-brained child, with
a heedless jerk of her elbow, which almost
upset the basket.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span></p>

<p>"Why, Lucy Abbott!" whispered Ninny;
"was that you stepping just behind me?"</p>

<p>"Behind you? No: why, I'm right
here."</p>

<p>"But I heard somebody," said Ninny,
pushing back her shaker and looking around
nervously.</p>

<p>Yes; and there, not far off, was Mrs.
Prim, walking beside a row of currant-bushes.
Could she be the one whose steps
Ninny had just heard on the gravel path
close by her side?</p>

<p>"Lucy," she whispered again, as the
lady's figure disappeared behind a syringa-tree.
"Lucy Abbott, she was right here
a minute ago; and she must have heard
what you said."</p>

<p>"Did she? What'd I say?"</p>

<p>"Don't you know, child, you asked me
why I didn't steal some money? That's
<i>just</i> what you said!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span></p>

<p>Lucy only laughed, and little Flaxie
pulled a pebble out of her shoe. Lucy and
Flaxie were thoughtless children; they never
took things to heart as Ninny did; and, as
for that little speech, what if Mrs. Prim
<i>had</i> heard it, wouldn't she know Lucy was
in fun?</p>

<p>But, when they went into the house, Lucy
remembered what she had said; and her
face was crimson. Somehow she could not
raise her eyes for shame.</p>

<p>"Move your chairs up to the drop-table,"
said Mrs. Prim, "and help me take off the
hulls."</p>

<p>That was what she always said; but
Ninny fancied that her voice was sharper
than usual. They all three hulled in silence
(Flaxie was not allowed near the
table); and then Mrs. Prim herself took
the berries off the large white platters and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
arranged them in the boxes: she never let
the children do that; and Ninny always
observed that she was very sure to put the
largest berries on top.</p>

<p>"They are unusually nice to-day," said
Mrs. Prim, as she placed the boxes carefully
in a market-basket, and gave the
basket to the little girls; "and you may
tell Mr. Potter that I expect half a dollar
a box for them, and am not willing to take
a cent less."</p>

<p>"Yes'm," murmured Flaxie, as Lucy and
Ninny trudged off down the dusty street,
with the basket between them.</p>

<p>Mr. Potter was in a very pleasant mood,
called them nice little girls, gave them all
three some candy, and said he was perfectly
willing to pay fifty cents for such
strawberries as theirs. He took the eight
boxes out of the market-basket, and, in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
their places, put back eight empty ones;
then gave Ninny a two-dollar bill for Mrs.
Prim.</p>

<p>When they returned to Mrs. Prim's,
there was no one at home but Kitty
Maloney.</p>

<p>"The money is in one of those boxes,
Kitty," said Ninny.</p>

<p>But Kitty did not hear; for she was just
opening the oven door to look at the Sunderland
pudding.</p>

<p>The children loitered along toward home.
The sun was cooling his face behind a
cloud, and there was really some comfort
now in walking. Ninny forgot Lucy's unlucky
speech in the garden, and only thought
how glad she should be for some dinner.</p>

<p>In the afternoon, the sun came out of
the cloud, and finished ripening some more
strawberries; and, next morning, Ninny,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
Lucy, and Flaxie were again in the beautiful
garden, picking into the same yellow
basket. Afterward, they sat with Mrs.
Prim beside the drop-table, and helped hull
the berries as usual.</p>

<p>"Wait a moment," said the sharp-voiced
lady, as they were about to start off with
the market-basket and the eight nice boxes.
"Wait a moment. Where is the money
Mr. Potter sent me yesterday?"</p>

<p>"Kate took it, ma'am," said Ninny; "it
was in one of the boxes."</p>

<p>"No, mum, I niver," spoke up Kitty,
turning round with a plate of fish in her
hand. "Nothing was niver said to <i>me</i>
about money, mum. I jist takes the boxes
out of the basket, and sets 'em in a row
on the pantry shelf, as ye bids me; but
it's the first that iver I heerd about money."</p>

<p>"What does this mean?" said Mrs.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
Prim, turning round, and giving Lucy a
severe look. "Are you sure Mr. Potter
paid you yesterday?"</p>

<p>"O, yes, ma'am: as sure as can be."</p>

<p>And Flaxie struck in with her favorite
ditty,&mdash;</p>

<p>"O, yes'm: serious, truly, black and
bluely; for <i>I</i> saw him do it."</p>

<p>"Kate, you may go up to the store, and
find out what this means," said Mrs. Prim,
without paying the least attention to
Flaxie. She had perfect faith in Kitty;
and well she might; for the girl had
lived with her fifteen years, and never told
her a lie. But what had become of the
money? It was certainly a pretty serious
question.</p>

<p>Kitty went to the store, and came back,
saying Mr. Potter had given the two dollars
to the children.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes, yes," said Mrs. Prim, looking at
Ninny and then at Lucy; "yes, yes."</p>

<p>That was all she said; but the girls felt
themselves trembling from head to foot.</p>

<p>"I don't know what's become of it
then," murmured Ninny, twisting her handkerchief.</p>

<p>"Nor I don't," said Lucy.</p>

<p>"Nor me, neither," said Flaxie.</p>

<p>"Yes, yes," repeated Mrs. Prim, looking
at Lucy again, and then at Ninny.</p>

<p>Ninny could bear it no longer, but
rushed out of the kitchen door, crying,
followed by Lucy and Flaxie, who tried to
cry, too, but hardly knew what was the
matter.</p>

<p>"O mamma, mamma," cried Ninny,
throwing herself on her mother's neck the
moment she got home; "I want you to
go with me right straight to Aunt Jane<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
Abbott's; for Mrs. Prim will come there
to tell an awful story about us."</p>

<p>"Why, child, I can't understand you,"
said Mrs. Gray, kissing Ninny's hot cheeks.
"What awful story can she tell about my
dear little daughter?"</p>

<p>"O, come quick, mamma. She'll go to
Aunt Jane's. She wouldn't dare come
here, for papa wouldn't let her talk so;
but she'll go to Aunt Jane's, for she thinks&mdash;she
thinks&mdash;we've stolen some money."</p>

<p>Mrs. Gray did not wait for any thing
more, but went at once with the children
to Mrs. Abbott's.</p>

<p>There all three of the little girls talked
so fast that Aunt Jane could hardly understand
them.</p>

<p>"The money was in one of the boxes,"
said Ninny.</p>

<p>"Mr. Potter gave it to Ninny," said Lucy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span></p>

<p>"And a stick of candy, too," cried Flaxie.</p>

<p>"And now Mr. Potter thinks we stole
the money. He thinks so in his heart,"
wailed Ninny. "Mr. Potter, that always
liked us, and was going to take Lucy in
his carriage to New York to see a vase
he thought would be pretty for Rose."</p>

<p>In the midst of this talk, there was a
quick, decided ring at the door-bell; and,
next moment, Mrs. Prim walked in.</p>

<p>"I wish you'd tell me what this means,"
said Mrs. Abbott, so bewildered that she
forgot to say, "How do you do?"</p>

<p>"Ask your little daughter what it
means," replied Mrs. Prim, throwing her
head back. She was a very straight, tall
woman; and, when she did throw her head
back, you felt a little afraid of her.</p>

<p>Mrs. Gray took a seat by the window,
and said nothing.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span></p>

<p>"Is it about some money?" asked Mrs.
Abbott.</p>

<p>"Yes," said Mrs. Prim, "it <i>is</i> about
some money. I suppose you can't believe
a word against Lucy; but I must tell you
what has happened.</p>

<p>"Yesterday morning, as I went into the
garden to pick a few flowers, I overheard
these three children talking together about
me. They were not speaking in a very
pleasant tone; but I shouldn't have minded
that if one of them&mdash;and I am very sure
it was Lucy&mdash;hadn't said,&mdash;</p>

<p>"'O, my, why don't <i>we</i> take some of
the money Mr. Potter pays us for the
berries, and keep it ourselves?'"</p>

<p>"Mrs. Prim!" cried Mrs. Abbott, her
face turning very white.</p>

<p>"O mamma, I said it in fun; of course
I said it in fun!" exclaimed poor little<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
Lucy, running about the room, and crying.</p>

<p>"In fun," echoed Mrs. Prim. "It didn't
sound very funny to me; especially when
you did keep the money, and then told me
you had given it to Kitty."</p>

<p>"We certainly gave it to Kitty," said
Ninny, clasping her hands together. "We
certainly did!"</p>

<p>"Serious, truly, black and bluely," put
in Miss Frizzle.</p>

<p>Mrs. Abbott was too excited to speak.
She was a good Christian, and meant to be
patient; but she was entirely sure these
little girls were innocent; and she thought
Mrs. Prim was very unkind and unjust to
come to her house and talk in this way.</p>

<p>At last she said quietly, looking straight
at the stern lady,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Please remember, Mrs. Prim, Lucy is
my own little daughter. It seems to me<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
you ought to be very sure you are right
before you tell a mother that her daughter
will <i>steal</i>!"</p>

<p>Mrs. Prim's face softened a little.</p>

<p>"I am sorry to hurt your feelings, Mrs.
Abbott," said she. "Everybody knows you
are a high-minded, good woman; but I
always thought you were rather too easy
with your children: you don't know how
Bert and Lucy behave when they are out
of your sight; and I felt it <i>my duty</i> to
come and tell you about this! I&mdash;"</p>

<p>"O! O! O!" struck in Flaxie, distressed
by the sad faces around her; "I wish I's
dead! I wish we's all dead and gone to
heaven!"</p>

<p>Of course Flaxie's tears were of no more
consequence than so much rain-water; but
her mother had to take her in her arms
and soothe her, while Aunt Jane answered
Mrs. Prim.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span></p>

<p>"This is a very strange affair, and I
can't understand it; but, as for thinking
my little Lucy would <i>steal</i>, why, you know
Mrs. Prim, I can't for one moment believe
it!"</p>

<p>"Well, to be sure, I don't much wonder
you can't. I shouldn't believe it myself, I
dare say, if I were you. But then, Mrs.
Abbott, you must confess things do look
very dark," said Mrs. Prim.</p>

<p>"Darker things than this have been
cleared up," said Mrs. Abbott.</p>

<p>Then Mrs. Gray thought <i>she</i> would
speak.</p>

<p>"Well, suppose we wait awhile, and don't
mention this to anybody, and see what
happens, Mrs. Prim?"</p>

<p>"I will wait a week, if you wish it,"
answered Mrs. Prim, rising to go; "and, at
the end of that time, I shall expect these<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
little girls to tell us the truth about this
money."</p>

<p>Mrs. Prim did not mean to be unkind,
but she was always sure she was right;
she never thought she could make mistakes.
As she walked in at her own gate, Kitty
Maloney met her at the front door.</p>

<p>"Sure, mum, it's me that's glad you've
got back," cried she, with a spoon in one
hand and a strawberry-box in the other.
"Mr. Potter jist sent up this box, and the
money was in it all right."</p>

<p>She held up the spoon, and there was a
two-dollar bill in it, dripping with red
juice.</p>

<p>Mrs. Prim stared at it.</p>

<p>"It's yours, mum! Mr. Snow's folks
got some of your strawb'ries, yesterday;
and, when they turns 'em out in a dish for
dinner, they sees this money a-laying under
'em, all soaked with the rid."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span></p>

<p>"So it <span class="smcap">WAS</span> in the box, after all; and
the children did give it to you," said Mrs.
Prim, feeling dreadfully ashamed.</p>

<p>"Yes, mum, I knew the nice children
wouldn't lie. You see, mum, you must
have done the mischief yourself; you must
have went and put your strawb'ries in this
box this morning, right a-top of the money,
mum, and niver seen it!"</p>

<p>Mrs. Prim understood it all now. Yes,
it must be so. Her spectacles had been
troubling her lately, and she had opened
the box without seeing the money!</p>

<p>As I have said, Mrs. Prim was dreadfully
ashamed; but she was a woman who meant
to do right; so she did not wait to take
her bonnet off, but walked right back to
Mrs. Abbott's, and showed her the red two-dollar
bill&mdash;the most beautiful scrap of
money that ever was seen! Mrs. Abbott
could have kissed it for joy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span></p>

<p>"Lucy must have it; I want Lucy to
keep it and try to forgive me," said Mrs.
Prim; and she actually had tears in her
eyes.</p>

<p>But, as Mrs. Abbott would not allow her
daughter to keep it, Mrs. Prim resolved to
make the children all a present. She
begged some of little Rosie's hair, and went
to New York that very afternoon and
bought three gold lockets, one for each of
the girls.</p>

<p>So it all ended very pleasantly, after all;
and this is as good a place as any to make
an end of our book.</p>
